          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Most plant-infecting rhabdoviruses are transmitted by one or a few closely related insect species. Additionally, intraspecific differences in transmission efficacy often exist among races/biotypes within vector species and among strains within a virus species. The black-faced leafhopper, <italic>Graminella nigrifrons</italic>, is the only known vector of the persistent propagative rhabdovirus <italic>Maize fine streak virus</italic> (MFSV). Only a small percentage of leafhoppers are capable of transmitting the virus, although the mechanisms underlying vector competence are not well understood.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methodology</title>
          <p>RNA-Seq was carried out to explore transcript expression changes and sequence variation in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> and MFSV that may be associated with the ability of the vector to acquire and transmit the virus. RT-qPCR assays were used to validate differential transcript accumulation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results/Significance</title>
          <p>Feeding on MFSV-infected maize elicited a considerable transcriptional response in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic>, with increased expression of cytoskeleton organization and immunity transcripts in infected leafhoppers. Differences between leafhoppers capable of transmitting MFSV, relative to non-transmitting but infected leafhoppers were more limited, which may reflect difficulties discerning between the two groups and/or the likelihood that the transmitter phenotype results from one or a few genetic differences. The ability of infected leafhoppers to transmit MFSV did not appear associated with virus transcript accumulation in the infected leafhoppers or sequence polymorphisms in the viral genome. However, the non-structural MFSV 3 gene was expressed at unexpectedly high levels in infected leafhoppers, suggesting it plays an active role in the infection of the insect host. The results of this study begin to define the functional roles of specific <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> and MFSV genes in the viral transmission process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Plant-infecting rhabdoviruses require arthropod vectors for their transmission to new host plants. There are more than 90 known plant rhabdoviruses, most of which are transmitted by hemipteran insects, including aphids (Aphididae), planthoppers (Delphacidae), and leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Plant rhabdoviruses are transmitted in a persistent propagative manner, replicating in and migrating through the insect across several molecular and physical barriers prior to being transmitted to a new plant host <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Following virus acquisition and before the vector becomes inoculative, there is a latency period of a few days to weeks, during which the virus replicates in the vector <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113529-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The movement and replication of rhabdoviruses in their insect hosts requires specific interactions between virus and vector components to overcome the major transmission barriers, which usually results in a high degree of vector specificity.</p>
      <p>Differences in rhabdovirus transmission efficiency have been reported among races/biotypes within the same vector species, and also among virus strains transmitted by the same insect vector <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Sylvester1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. <italic>Graminella nigrifrons</italic> is a common leafhopper on wheat, maize, and other grasses in the eastern U.S <xref rid="pone.0113529-Stoner1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Kramer1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is the only known vector of <italic>Maize fine streak virus</italic> (MFSV; family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Nucleorhabdovirus</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0113529-Redinbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, within a laboratory population, only a small percentage of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> exposed to MFSV were capable of transmitting the virus <xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In the remainder of the population, some individuals were hosts of but did not transmit MFSV, and others were not virus hosts. These groups of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> were categorized as &#x2018;transmitters&#x2019;, which acquired and transmitted virus (i.e., they are vectors); &#x2018;acquirers&#x2019;, which acquired but did not transmit MFSV; and, &#x2018;non-acquirers&#x2019;, which did not retain virus after feeding on maize infected with MFSV <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The underlying mechanisms that determine the transmission efficacy of MFSV and other rhabdoviruses are not well understood.</p>
      <p>Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors are thought to influence the capability of insects to acquire, maintain, and transmit pathogens <xref rid="pone.0113529-Hogenhout1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Nault1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, traits that have a genetic component are of the greatest significance&#x2014;a discordant genetic interaction will not result in competent vectors even if the environment is suitable <xref rid="pone.0113529-Power1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Gray1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is thought that genetic elements in both the vector and virus and their interactions determine whether an individual insect within a species is capable of vectoring a particular virus strain <xref rid="pone.0113529-Gray2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Assessment of pathogen-induced transcriptional changes in insect vectors has been key for identifying genes contributing to pathogen host responses, and providing insights into the molecular and cellular processes important for pathogen infection and transmission <xref rid="pone.0113529-Baton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently, investigations into the regulatory control of insect immune systems are most advanced for <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> but data are becoming increasingly available for plant-infecting vectors <xref rid="pone.0113529-Luan1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our recent work indicated <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> responds to feeding on MFSV-infected plants by increasing transcript levels of genes involved in immune defenses <xref rid="pone.0113529-Cassone1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, in these experiments, transcript abundance was characterized without regard to the transmission competence of individual leafhoppers. While leafhopper populations composed only of transmitters, acquirers, or non-acquirers have yet to be selected, a combination of laboratory and greenhouse assays has been developed to distinguish individuals based on their transmission group <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We hypothesized that the differences in MFSV transmission capability among individual leafhoppers have a significant genetic component (e.g., regulatory or sequence divergence).</p>
      <p>The sequencing and assembly of the MFSV genome <xref rid="pone.0113529-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transcriptome <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> provide valuable tools for exploring the transcriptional basis of vector competence. We hypothesized that transcript expression and sequence variation in the vector and virus contribute to MFSV infection of and transmission by <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic>, and used RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR approaches to examine differences among <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transmission groups and MFSV. This study provides novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the capacity of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> to transmit MFSV.</p>

        <p>Experiments were carried out using a laboratory colony of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> established from multiple, ongoing field collections taken near Wooster, OH since the early 1980s (40.8050&#xB0;N, 81.9353&#xB0;W). Leafhoppers were maintained on maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L. &#x2018;Early Sunglow&#x2019;, Schlessman Seed Co., Milan, OH) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Gingery1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Growth chamber conditions for all experiments consisted of 28&#xB0;C/16 h day and a 22&#xB0;C/8 h night cycle.</p>
        <p>The MFSV isolate was originally isolated from southwestern Georgia (U.S.A.) <xref rid="pone.0113529-Redinbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and was maintained in the sweetcorn hybrid &#x2018;Early Sunglow&#x2019; by serial transmission with <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic><xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To produce MFSV-infected experimental plants, symptomatic leaf tissue was ground in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (1&#x2236;4 g/ml) and inoculated onto healthy seeds of the sweetcorn hybrid &#x2018;Spirit&#x2019; by vascular puncture inoculation (VPI) as previously described <xref rid="pone.0113529-Redinbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. At two days post-inoculation (dpi), seeds were planted into greenhouse soil and moved a growth chamber.</p>

        <p>For virus acquisition, gravid <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> females were placed on symptomatic MFSV-infected maize for oviposition. After 2 d, adults were removed and nymphs were allowed to feed on the infected plants for 6 wks. Fresh symptomatic plants were added every 2 wks during the acquisition period. Subsequently, 300 adults were randomly selected and individually transferred to healthy &#x2018;test&#x2019; plants (4 d old &#x2018;Spirit&#x2019; seedlings) for a 7 d inoculation period. After the 7 d, leafhoppers were harvested and individually stored in RNase-free tubes at &#x2212;80&#xB0;C until RNA isolation. Test plants were then moved to a greenhouse for 4 wks for symptom development.</p>
        <p>For the experimental treatments, <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> individuals were separated into transmitters, acquirers, and non-acquirers as previously described <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Briefly, an insect was designated as a transmitter if the corresponding test plant developed symptoms and MFSV was detected in the leafhopper by RT-PCR, as outlined below. Individuals were designated acquirers if MFSV was detected by RT-PCR, but the test plant did not develop symptoms, and non-acquirers if they were negative by both assays (test plant symptom development and RT-PCR). <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> fed on healthy &#x2018;Spirit&#x2019; maize for the same time period and reared under identical conditions as the treatment leafhoppers were collected as the healthy control. The experiment (treatments and control) was replicated three times using leafhoppers from different cohorts.</p>

      <p>In these experiments, we examined transcript expression and sequence changes in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> and MFSV that might be linked to insect vector competence. <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> were fed on MFSV-infected maize for six weeks followed by one week on healthy plants, then evaluated for their ability to acquire and transmit MFSV. Twelve cDNA libraries were constructed and sequenced: one each for non-acquirers, acquirers, transmitters, and leafhoppers fed on healthy plants in each of three independent experiments. The sequence analysis generated &#x223C;231 million raw 100 bp paired end reads. After preprocessing and duplicate read removal, 9.1 to 20.5 million non-redundant reads were obtained per sample.

        <p>Differences in transcript expression between leafhoppers in each transmission group and the control group fed on healthy maize were identified using Bayes-moderated <italic>t</italic>-tests (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Across the three transmission groups, 14,062 differentially expressed transcripts were identified. Most of these transcripts (87%) were also identified using the edgeR package, indicating good correlation between the two statistical approaches. More differentially expressed transcripts were detected in transmitters (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;10,417) and acquirers (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;8,619) than in non-acquirers (n&#x200A;=&#x200A;4,910). Thus, between 13% and 30% of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transcripts were differentially expressed in the three treatments, suggesting that six weeks of feeding on MFSV-infected plants followed by one week on healthy plants impacted the transcriptional profiles of leafhoppers, regardless of whether they become infected with the virus or not.

        <p>Notable was a cluster of 19 transcripts functioning in cytoskeleton organization. Virus-induced cytoskeleton reorganization is a common strategy for virus transport to replication sites in insect cells <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ciampor1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113529-Schoelz1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. For example, the release of <italic>Rice gall dwarf virus</italic> from cultured insect vector cells requires virus association with microtubules <xref rid="pone.0113529-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In addition, tubular structures induced by the <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> Pns10 protein facilitate virus replication in the vector <xref rid="pone.0113529-Wei2" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Little information is currently available on the intracellular movement of plant-infecting rhabdoviruses in their insect hosts. We speculate that MFSV associates with leafhopper cytoskeleton components to allow movement of the virus into intracellular destinations of the host for replication.</p>
        <p>An ATPase, AAA+ cluster was also upregulated in acquirers and transmitters. Based on the <italic>Drosopohila</italic> orthologs in this cluster, it contains transcripts that encode proteins belonging to several immune-related families <xref rid="pone.0113529-Bartholomay1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113529-Waterhouse2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These include a caspase (FBtr0085482), a clip-domain serine protease (FBtr0080000), a multidrug-resistance protein (FBtr0090025) and Dicer-2 of the small RNA regulatory pathway (FBtr0086904). Immune-related transcripts not in the ATPase, AAA+ cluster were also identified, including a MD2-like receptor (FBtr0085723) and a member of the Toll pathway (FBtr0075607). Other studies indicate a significant component of the insect host transcriptome response to persistent propagatively transmitted viruses is immune-related <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Whitfield1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Moreover, the induction of immune transcripts was a major response of <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> fed on MFSV-infected maize for shorter durations of 4 h and 1 wk, although the response involved a different set of immune transcripts <xref rid="pone.0113529-Cassone1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Four transcripts encoding proteins with significant homology to viral A-type inclusion proteins (ATIPs) were upregulated in the MFSV-infected leafhoppers (i.e., transmitters and acquirers). Three of the four transcripts had a best match to different regions of a <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> ATIP nucleotide sequence (NCBI protein accession XP_001319570) and one best matched a <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> ATIP (NCBI protein accession YP_001390559.1). Inclusions are of interest since they are used by viruses to concentrate cellular and viral proteins, thereby representing sites of virus replication and assembly <xref rid="pone.0113529-Moshe1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Tilsner1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Plant-infecting rhabdoviruses, particularly nucleorhabdoviruses, are known to form electron-dense inclusions inside the nucleus of infected cells, known as viroplasms <xref rid="pone.0113529-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Some plant RNA viruses induce the rearrangement of host membranes structures to form the viroplasm <xref rid="pone.0113529-Moshe1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, which is consistent with the upregulation of cytoskeleton reorganization transcripts in acquirers and transmitters. Little is understood about the mechanism of viroplasm formation; however, in most cases it involves the recruitment of both virus components and host machinery <xref rid="pone.0113529-Moshe1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Bak1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. While there were no ATIP sequence signatures in the MFSV genome, it is conceivable that MFSV recruits host leafhopper ATIPS to inclusion sites. The putative <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> ATIPs did not show significant nucleotide similarity to other insect species in the nr database; however, a putative ATIP was abundantly found in the midgut of the planthopper, <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0113529-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, suggesting they may be pervasive in hemipteran insects of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Future targeted studies will be needed to disentangle the function roles (if any) of these putative ATIPs in virus replication and assembly.</p>

        <title>Similar transcript expression in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> acquirers or transmitters</title>
        <p>Although MFSV replicates in both <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> acquirers and transmitters, only the transmitters were empirically found to transmit the virus to new host plants <xref rid="pone.0113529-Todd1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Compared to the healthy control, more transcripts were upregulated than downregulated in acquirers (175 and 27, respectively) and transmitters (135 and 20, respectively). For the acquirers, no DAVID annotation clusters were identified and only 25 upregulated and 2 downregulated transcripts could be assigned a putative function using BLASTx (<italic>E</italic>-value &lt; 10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup>). Of interest were two induced dolichyldiphosphatases. These enzymes participate in N-glycan biosynthesis, which plays a critical role in cell recognition and adhesion, with carbohydrate-dependent interactions being essential for immune function <xref rid="pone.0113529-Varki1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Two significant DAVID annotation clusters were among the transcripts upregulated in transmitters only: one for cellular component movement (8 transcripts; score&#x200A;=&#x200A;1.38) and one for intracellular signaling (8 transcripts; score&#x200A;=&#x200A;1.62). MFSV appears to take a neurotropic route from the midgut into the salivary glands in their leafhopper vectors, similar to that of some vertebrate-infecting rhabdoviruses <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Ammar4" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Transcripts in these clusters may be important for facilitating this virus movement into the salivary glands.</p>
        <p>Few genes have been directly implicated in insect host transmission efficiency of rhabdoviruses. Most of the available information is for the <italic>Sigma viruses</italic>, a clade of viruses in the family <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, which naturally infects dipterans. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, resistance alleles in the genes <italic>ref(2)p</italic> and <italic>CHKov</italic> 1 and 2 explain a large amount of the genetic variation in <italic>Sigma virus</italic> susceptibility <xref rid="pone.0113529-Bangham1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113529-Magwire1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. However, orthologs of each of these genes were not detected in the <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> transcriptome <xref rid="pone.0113529-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113529-Cassone1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> nor were transcripts of similar function differentially regulated between acquirers and transmitters.</p>
        <p>Unlike non-acquirers, which can be easily distinguished from acquirers and transmitters on multiple levels, the distinction between acquirers and transmitters is based only on transmission efficacy and may not correlate perfectly with genotype. It is possible that a substantial proportion of the acquirers are capable vectors, but did not transmit MFSV to test plants during the one week inoculation period. Inability to accurately detect transmitters would skew the resultant expression values for the acquirers. The relatively small number of transcripts differentially expressed between acquirers and transmitters lend support this possibility. Moreover, the differences between the two transmission groups are likely due to one or a few genetic differences, and the gene(s) of interest may not be obvious using the transcriptome approach. Further studies are needed to identify factors that potentially confound our phenotype-driven transmission categories and influence the genetic analyses. For instance, RNAi knockdown of transcripts upregulated only the transmitters may implicate a gene in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> vector competence if the overall rate of MFSV transmission declines significantly.</p>

Genome sequence polymorphisms can affect viral pathogenesis, virulence, and transmission, and have been identified as one of the major forces driving adaption of RNA viruses to new hosts <xref rid="pone.0113529-Kuzmin1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0113529-Moya1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. We identified 22 fixed SNPs among acquirers, transmitters, and the reference 13,782 bp MFSV genome from virus isolated from maize <xref rid="pone.0113529-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. SNPs were identified in all genes except MFSV 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113529-t003">Table 3</xref>). Only two of the SNP produced nonsynonymous changes in the viral sequence relative to the reference genome: a glutamic acid to aspartic acid change at residue 461 of the MFSV N protein; and a methionine to threonine change at residue 233 of the MFSV L protein. No fixed nucleotide differences were identified between acquirers and transmitters. The MFSV reference genome sequence was determined from MFSV isolated from infected plant tissue, and may reflect a viral genome sequence that is not capable of infecting in leafhoppers, and the identified SNP may be advantageous for MFSV infection of leafhoppers. No fixed SNPs were identified between acquirers and transmitters, although seven were detected at &gt;80% frequency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0113529-t002">Table 2</xref>). It is possible that these SNPs represent fixed differences, with the lower frequencies attributed to the difficulties in discerning among individual transmitters from acquirers.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>Genetic components in both the vector and virus and their interactions are major determinants of whether an individual within a species can transmit a virus. In this study, we used RNA-Seq to explore genetic changes in <italic>G. nigrifrons</italic> and MFSV that may be associated with the ability of the insect vector to acquire and transmit the virus. The consistency in MFSV transmission rates across replicates and studies provides evidence that intraspecific transmission capacity is a least partially genetically determined. Non-acquirers were distinguished from acquirers and transmitters, with substantial differences in the regulation of cytoskeleton organization and immunity genes. Genetic differences between acquirers and transmitters were more limited, which may be due to inherent difficulties discriminating between the two groups and/or the likelihood that the transmitter phenotype results from one or a few genetic differences. The competence of infected leafhoppers to transmit MFSV does not appear associated with virus transcript abundance in leafhoppers or sequence polymorphisms in the viral genome. However, the non-structural MFSV 3 gene was expressed at unexpectedly high levels in infected leafhoppers, suggesting it plays an active role in the infection of the insect host. Further studies are needed to identify factors that potentially confound our phenotype-driven transmission categories and influence the genetic analyses.</p>
