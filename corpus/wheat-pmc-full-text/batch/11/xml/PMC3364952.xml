        <p><italic>WOR1</italic> is a gene for a conserved fungal regulatory protein controlling the dimorphic switch and pathogenicity determents in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and its ortholog in the plant pathogen <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, called <italic>SGE1</italic>, is required for pathogenicity and expression of key plant effector proteins. <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, an important pathogen of cereals, is not known to employ switching and no effector proteins from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> have been found to date that are required for infection. In this study, the potential role of the <italic>WOR1</italic>-like gene in pathogenesis was tested in this toxigenic fungus. Deletion of the <italic>WOR1</italic> ortholog (called <italic>FGP1</italic>) in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> results in greatly reduced pathogenicity and loss of trichothecene toxin accumulation in infected wheat plants and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The loss of toxin accumulation alone may be sufficient to explain the loss of pathogenicity to wheat. Under toxin-inducing conditions, expression of genes for trichothecene biosynthesis and many other genes are not detected or detected at lower levels in &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains. <italic>FGP1</italic> is also involved in the developmental processes of conidium formation and sexual reproduction and modulates a morphological change that accompanies mycotoxin production <italic>in vitro</italic>. The Wor1-like proteins in <italic>Fusarium</italic> species have highly conserved N-terminal regions and remarkably divergent C-termini. Interchanging the N- and C- terminal portions of proteins from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic> resulted in partial to complete loss of function. Wor1-like proteins are conserved but have evolved to regulate pathogenicity in a range of fungi, likely by adaptations to the C-terminal portion of the protein.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Plant pathogenic fungi can have devastating effects on crop yield and quality. In addition, these fungi may generate mycotoxins that pose health risks when the contaminated crops are consumed. The pathogen <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> infects wheat heads and grows through the rachis by synthesizing trichothecene toxins. The mechanisms and environmental cues triggering the production of trichothecene toxins have been studied for many years. Here, we describe a fungal gene, <italic>Fgp1</italic>, that is absolutely required for pathogenicity and mycotoxin synthesis during infection and in culture. <italic>Fgp1</italic> is not required for vegetative growth of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> but is important for reproductive development and potentially for a putative switch from a vegetative to a pathogenic phase. Deletion of <italic>Fgp1</italic> results in reduced expression of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene cluster and genes specifically expressed during toxin synthesis <italic>in planta</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Fgp1 contains a conserved N-terminal domain and a divergent in the C-terminal region. The corresponding C-terminus from a sister species, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, is unable to function fully in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> when fused to the conserved <italic>F. graminearum</italic> N-terminal domain, suggesting the gene function is highly species specific.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pathogenic fungi have evolved sophisticated ways to infect their hosts, mainly by adapting to the host environment and by producing pathogenicity-related products such as toxic secondary metabolites, effector proteins and/or extracellular enzymes. The expression of genes involved in the adaptation to a host and synthesis of pathogenicity factors are under tight regulation to assure successful infection and survival. The pathogenic fungus <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> is a devastating pathogen of wheat and barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Goswami1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Trail1">[2]</xref> and modulates its pathogenicity largely by regulating a cluster of genes encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of trichothecene toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Ilgen1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Jansen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Kimura1">[5]</xref>. These mycotoxins are required during wheat infection to breach the rachis node of spikelets which acts as a barrier to systemic infection and maximal head blight symptoms. Toxin production during infection depends on multiple cellular and environmental factors (see recent review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Merhej1">[6]</xref>) and yet, exactly how the genes for trichothecene biosynthesis are regulated is still largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Another member of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> genus, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse1">[7]</xref>, contains both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Pathogenic <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> strains modulate their pathogenicity in part by secreting small secreted proteins which may act both as virulence and as avirulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Takken1">[8]</xref>. In the tomato wilt pathogen <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>lycopersici</italic>, the nuclear protein Sge1 was demonstrated to be required for parasitic growth and expression of the small-secreted proteins genes <italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>SIX2</italic>, <italic>SIX3</italic> and <italic>SIX5</italic>, during conditions mimicking <italic>in planta</italic> growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref>. A &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> mutant was still able to colonize roots, but was unable to reach the normally infected xylem vessels. Recently an orthologous gene in the necrotrophic plant pathogen <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, <italic>REG1</italic>, was shown to be required for infection of bean leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse3">[10]</xref>, indicating that these genes may have a conserved role in fungal plant pathogenicity.</p>
      <p><italic>SGE1</italic> and <italic>REG1</italic> are orthologs of <italic>WOR1</italic> from <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>RYP1</italic> in <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Huang1">[12]</xref>. In these human pathogenic fungi, both proteins are involved in the dimorphic switch, a transition correlated with the ability to cause disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Lohse1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Holbrook1">[14]</xref>. This suggests that the orthologous proteins found in plant pathogens also may be involved in switching from a saprophytic to a parasitic lifestyle. In this study we characterize the ortholog of <italic>WOR1</italic> in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, and show that it is absolutely required for pathogenicity and regulates the expression of the trichothecene biosynthetic (<italic>TRI</italic>) genes <italic>in planta</italic> as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>. It also apparently mediates a morphological change during toxin production, and, as determined by transcriptome analysis, regulates the expression of other genes, many of which are related to pathogenicity.</p>
      <p>In order to study functional conservation of the orthologs from the two <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, we interchanged the genes and as well as swapped the C-terminal portions of the genes between the species. We found that the gene from the opposite species was not fully functional in the other species, nor were the chimeric genes. Additionally, very little overlap was found among genes regulated by each protein during vegetative growth. The results from these experiments show that the family of Wor1-like proteins regulates pathogenicity in many fungi through transcriptional reprogramming. Additionally, two members in two closely related <italic>Fusarium</italic> species have evolved different function, presumably in order to adapt to successfully infect their different hosts.</p>

        <title>Conservation of WOR1-like genes in <italic>Fusarium</italic></title>
        <p>Most fungi have two homologous proteins encoded by the <italic>WOR1</italic> gene family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref>, which are recognized by a common <italic>GTI1</italic>/<italic>PAC2</italic> domain, named after the <italic>WOR1</italic>-like genes <italic>GTI1</italic> and <italic>PAC2</italic> of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Caspari1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Kunitomo1">[16]</xref>. Phylogenetically, the two paralogous genes from each species sort into two different clades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref> with e.g. <italic>GTI1</italic>, <italic>WOR1</italic>, <italic>RYP1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> residing in one clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref> and e.g. <italic>PAC2</italic> from <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>PAC2</italic> from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in the other clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref>. In <italic>F. oxysporum SGE1</italic> is required for pathogenicity whereas <italic>PAC2</italic> is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref>. <italic>F. graminearum</italic> also has these two <italic>WOR1</italic>-like homologs. The gene that shows the highest similarity to <italic>SGE1</italic> from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and aligns with the <italic>WOR1</italic> clade is FGSG_12164 that we have named <italic>FGP1</italic> (<italic><underline>F</underline>. graminearum <underline>G</underline>TI1</italic>/<italic><underline>P</underline>AC2</italic> 1). The predicted <italic>FGP1</italic> gene is 1029 bp, intronless and encodes a 342 amino acid protein. The paralogous gene from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> that shows the highest similarity to <italic>PAC2</italic> from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and aligns with the <italic>PAC2</italic> clade is FGSG_10796 that we have renamed <italic>FGP2</italic> (<italic><underline>F</underline>. graminearum <underline>G</underline>TI1</italic>/<italic><underline>P</underline>AC2</italic> 2). The predicted <italic>FGP2</italic> gene is 1266 bp, intronless and encodes a 421 amino acid protein.</p>
        <p>In order to assess the conservation of the Fgp1/Sge1 and Fgp2/Pac2 proteins in more <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, we obtained the sequences of the respective proteins from two other sequenced <italic>Fusarium</italic> strains, <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> and <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> f. sp. <italic>pisi</italic> (also known as <italic>Nectria haematococca</italic>), using the BLAST function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Altschul1">[17]</xref> on the websites of the Broad Institute and the DOE Joint Genome Institute, respectively. As for <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, two genes were found for <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> as well as for <italic>F. solani</italic>. The genes that show the highest similarity to <italic>SGE1</italic> and <italic>FGP1</italic> and align with the <italic>WOR1</italic> clade are FVEG_09150 and Fs_81912 of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>, respectively. The genes that show the highest similarity to <italic>PAC2</italic> and <italic>FGP2</italic> and align with the <italic>PAC2</italic> clade are FVEG_11476 and Fs_60837 of <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>, respectively.</p>
        <p>When we aligned the four protein sequences of the Wor1 clade (Fo Sge1, FVEG_09150, Fg Fgp1 and Fs_81912), we found great divergence between the sequences of the four <italic>Fusarium</italic> proteins. Conservation is mainly restricted to the N-terminal portion (first &#xB1;220 amino acids in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) of which the total similarity percentage ranges from 64&#x2013;90.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The C-terminal portions (last first &#xB1;140 amino acids, grey shaded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) of the <italic>Fusarium</italic> orthologs from the Wor1-clade are highly diverged despite of the high numbers of glutamine residues in all four sequences (5.6&#x2013;13.6%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s008">Table S1B</xref>). Overall sequence similarity is as low as 37% between <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>. The sequences of the <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> ortholog and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> Sge1 share the highest similarity; 65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). On the contrary, when we aligned the four protein sequences of the Pac2 clade (Fo Pac2, FVEG_11476, Fg Fgp2 and Fs_60837), high similarities and conservation among the four <italic>Fusarium</italic> proteins (80&#x2013;97%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s008">Table S1A</xref>) are observed throughout the N-terminal and C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Spread of &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains is restricted to the inoculated spikelet</title>
        <p>As previously mentioned, no spread of disease symptoms was observed with the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> mutant compared to wild type. To determine the reason for this, we investigated whether the symptoms in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic> mutants are correlated to the growth of the mutant strains within the wheat head, using bright light and fluorescent microscopy. Since no differences in symptoms were observed between wild type PH-1 and &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic>, the latter was used as a fluorescent positive control strain. After inoculation, spread of the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic> strains were monitored through the spikelet for two weeks. At three days after inoculation, &#x201C;fluffy&#x201D; mycelium growing from of the inoculated spikelet was observed for the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain to the same extent as wild type (data not shown) and the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain had infected the palea and a portion of the lemma but had not spread towards the glume on the outer part of the spikelet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Even after two weeks, the glume was still green and apparently healthy. Presence of the fungus in the palea and lemma is manifested by browning of the tissue and was verified by microscopy (data not shown). In contrast to &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic>, the &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic> strain had infected the palea, the lemma and had spread to the glume after three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). For both &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic> strains, <italic>GFP</italic> is coupled to the constitutively expressed hygromycin B resistance gene <italic>HPH</italic>, making it possible to follow the growth inside the plant using hyphal fluorescence. Doing so, we identified the rachis node as the flower tissue where growth of the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> mutant was halted. No fluorescence from the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> mutant was found in the rachis node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, red circle) nor was fluorescence detected beyond the rachis over the complete time period of two weeks. Growth of &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> was observed in other spikelet parts after three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, white arrow). In contrast, fluorescence of the &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic> mutant was found in the flower (arrow) as well as in the rachis node and beyond after three days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, red circle). The inability of the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> mutant to penetrate the rachis node and the consequential pathogenicity loss might be caused solely by the lack of trichothecene production by the <italic>fgp1</italic> mutant. This inference is made because &#x394;<italic>tri5</italic> mutants of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, lacking the gene for the first enzymatic step in toxin synthesis, are unable to produce trichothecene toxins <italic>in planta</italic> and also are stalled during infection at the rachis node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Maier1">[21]</xref>.</p>

        <p>When strains were grown on carrot agar to induce perithecium and ascospore formation, it was observed that perithecia formed by the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain are comparable to wild type (data not shown). Ascospore formation on the other hand was delayed by one week in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain and altogether only a few ascospores emerged from the perithecia. Cirrhi of wild type PH-1 and a <italic>FGP1</italic> complementation strain appear one week after the formation of the perithecia and consist of strings of ascospores emerging from perithecia (data not shown). Cirrhi of the <italic>FGP1</italic> deletion strains appear two weeks after the formation of the perithecia and contain only a few ascospores at the perithecial apex (data not shown). When the ascospores were harvested and counted, fewer ascospores (p&#x2264;0.01, Student's t-Test) were produced by the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This defect was restored in the complementation strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These observations indicate that <italic>FGP1</italic> is involved the developmental processes of conidiogenesis and ascospore formation although these processes are not fully abolished in the deletion mutant. As a consequence of this impaired conidiogenesis, the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain probably displayed delayed germination on certain media.

        <p>Since the Fgp2 homolog Pac2 is involved in the sexual cycle of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, we also tested whether perithecium and ascospore formation was altered in the &#x394;<italic>fgp2</italic> strain.

        <title>Fgp1 in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is required for <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression and toxin production <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>F. graminearum</italic> produces trichothecene toxins when grown on medium containing polyamine compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Gardiner1">[22]</xref> and that this medium induces the expression of genes involved in trichothecene production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Kimura1">[5]</xref>. Since trichothecene toxins did not accumulate in wheat spikelets inoculated with &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic>, we investigated whether deletion strains also are impaired in production of toxin <italic>in vitro</italic>. In order to do this, the wild type, four independent &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains and two independent complemented strains were inoculated into putrescine containing medium and after one week assessed for the presence of trichothecene toxins. Toxin was found in wild type cultures but no toxin was detected in the cultures of the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Toxin was also found in the cultures of the two complemented strains albeit to slightly lower levels than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
        <p>The lack of toxin production in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains could be due to the inability to express the genes from the <italic>TRI</italic> cluster. In order to test for this, a northern blot experiment was performed. Both wild type PH-1 and a &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain were grown in minimal medium containing the polyamine putrescine or in control minimal medium with NaNO<sub>3</sub> as the sole nitrogen source instead of putrescine. Samples for RNA isolation were taken 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 or 48 hrs after inoculation and the RNA was used for gel electrophoresis and capillary blotting. Northern blots were hybridized with <italic>TRI14</italic>, a gene from the trichothecene biosynthetic cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Dyer1">[23]</xref> or with a constitutively expressed actin gene used as the loading control. <italic>TRI14</italic> is expressed to high levels during growth in polyamine medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Gardiner2">[24]</xref> and is therefore a good marker gene for the expression of the <italic>TRI</italic> cluster. No <italic>TRI14</italic> transcript was observed in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> mutant strain grown in putrescine medium at any time point in contrast to wild type PH-1 in which expression of <italic>TRI14</italic> was detected at 32, 40 and 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). RNAs corresponding to <italic>TRI14</italic> were not detected in cultures grown in minimal medium for either wild type or &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> (data not shown). <italic>Actin</italic> transcripts were detected in all samples of wild type and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic>, indicating equal loading.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the cultures filtrates of the different samples revealed that trichothecene toxins were present in the putrescine medium containing wild type PH-1 at 32 h and accumulated to higher levels at 40 and 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). No toxin was detected for the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain grown in putrescine medium at any time point nor in control medium, which is consistent with the previous toxin analysis experiment and the lack of <italic>TRI14</italic> gene expression. The &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain exhibits growth equal to wild type in putrescine medium (data not shown), suggesting that it likely can take up putrescine and use it as a nitrogen source but this does not lead to <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression. In minimal medium lacking any nitrogen source, growth of both wild type and the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain was noticeably reduced and no toxin was detected (data not shown). This suggests that <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression is not triggered by the absence of a nitrogen source but rather that putrescine is a specific inducer. Clearly, Fgp1 is required for putrescine induced trichothecene production.</p>
        <p>The full HPLC spectra of the wild type and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> samples grown for 40 hours in putrescine medium were, besides used for trichothecene toxin identification, also inspected for other differences in metabolite profiles. Doing so, no significant peaks other than the peaks corresponding to DON and 15-ADON are missing in the spectrum from the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This suggests that &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> can still produce a majority of the other metabolites present in the spectrum and that it does not appear to be impaired in production of metabolites in general.</p>

        <title>A hyphal morphological change is observed in putrescine medium for both the wild type and the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain</title>
        <p>To examine in more detail why <italic>TRI</italic> gene expression was not observed in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain, wild type PH-1, &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and complemented strain were grown in putrescine medium and examined microscopically. In all strains, a distinct morphological change in hyphae was observed when cultures were grown in putrescine medium for 40 h compared to control medium. In control medium, hyphae display a uniform thickness over their entire length and grow in long branches in wild type, &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic>, and complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g006">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel). In putrescine medium, the wild type and complemented strains display hyphae that produce bulbous sub-apical structures, which are to some extent also observed in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g006">Figure 6</xref>, center panel). In wild type and complemented strain, bulbous structures up to 21 &#xB5;m in diameter are observed among numerous other, but fewer and smaller bulbous structures are observed in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g006">Figure 6</xref>, lower panel). Another independent &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and complemented strain displayed similar growth morphology as the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and complemented strain given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

A representative area of the mycelium observed under the microscope is given for each strain. Mycelium of wild type PH-1 and the complemented strain show branching and numerous hyphae with bulbous structures when compared to mycelium grown in control minimal medium. Mycelium of the <italic>FGP1</italic> deletion strain also shows branching but fewer hyphae with bulbous structures. Greater magnifications of the boxed frames from the middle pictures (lower panel) show that in the mycelium of the wild type and complemented strains many bulbous structures are formed (left and right pictures in the lower panel). The mycelium of the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain shows some bulbous structures but less when compared to with wild type and complemented strain (middle picture in the lower panel). Bulbous structures are indicated by arrows in the middle and lower panels.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether this morphological change in the putrescine medium parallels the expression of <italic>TRI</italic> genes and trichothecene accumulation we also examined the cultures at the different time points. After 16 and 24 h, some hyphae begin to swell and form bulbous structures in both wild type and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains (see arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These structures become more abundant at 32 h in the wild type but not in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain (see arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s004">Figure S4</xref>). At 40 and 48 h, large bulbous structures appear in the wild type which are less apparent in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain (see arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This suggests that the formation of these bulbous structures might be involved in the production of trichothecene toxins and that somehow the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain is less capable to form the same structures as in wild type.</p>
        <p>To examine whether the bulbous structures observed in wild type are formed as a consequence of toxin production or whether the structures may accommodate toxin production, a &#x394;<italic>tri6</italic> mutant was grown in putrescine and control minimal medium. <italic>TRI6</italic> encodes a transcription factor that is absolutely required for the expression of the genes in the <italic>TRI</italic> cluster and for trichothecene synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Seong1">[25]</xref>. The &#x394;<italic>tri6</italic> strain lacks detectable trichothecene accumulation in the putrescine medium (data not shown), but the hyphae show the same degree of hyphal swelling and bulbous structure formation as the wild type (data not shown). We conclude from this that the bulbous cells do not form in response to trichothecene synthesis because they appear to develop before transcription of the <italic>TRI</italic> genes, and the toxins themselves, can be detected. It remains unclear what the exact role this hyphal swelling plays in toxin synthesis and how Fgp1 might be involved in the facilitation of this process.</p>

        <title>Fgp1 regulates many genes during growth in putrescine medium and during infection</title>
        <p>To investigate the underlying genetic basis for the differences in toxin accumulation and hyphal morphology seen in putrescine medium, RNA was extracted from wild type PH-1 (three independent samples) and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains (three independent samples) after growing 40 h in putrescine and labeled for microarray experiments. Additionally, in order to find genes regulated by Fgp1 during <italic>in planta</italic> growth, RNA was extracted from wheat heads inoculated for 72 hours with wild type (three independent samples, three heads per sample with ten inoculated spikelets per head) or &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> (three independent samples, three heads per sample with ten inoculated spikelets per head) and labeled for microarray experiments. The number of genes showing a &gt;2-fold difference in average expression between wild type PH-1 and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains during growth on putrescine medium and during wheat infection were determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Fgp1 appears to regulate gene expression positively as well as negatively during growth in putrescine medium and infection of wheat with hundreds of genes differentially expressed. In total, 654 genes show a &gt;2.0-fold (P&lt;0.05) lower expression in &#x394;<italic>fgp</italic>1 compared to wild type when grown in putrescine and 536 genes show higher expression in &#x394;<italic>fgp</italic>1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s009">Table S2</xref>). Additionally, 634 genes were &#x2265;2-fold lower expressed (P&lt;0.05) in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain compared to wild type during wheat infection and 39 genes were found &gt;2 fold higher expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s010">Table S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Some overlap is found between genes positively or negatively regulated by Fgp1 in putrescine medium and those regulated during wheat infection (91 and 3 genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s005">Figure S5</xref>)). Recently, a gene set considered to be expressed &#x201C;<italic>in planta</italic> only&#x201D; was described containing genes from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> exclusively expressed during plant infection but not in axenic cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Lysoe1">[26]</xref>. Out of the 369 genes from this gene set, 243 were found expressed in the experiments described here, either in wild type or the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain grown in putrescine medium (45 genes) or in infected wheat (199 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s011">Table S4</xref>). Overlap was found between these 243 &#x201C;<italic>in planta</italic> only&#x201D; genes and genes lower or higher expressed in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain in putrescine medium or during wheat head infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Altogether, Fgp1 regulates a remarkably large proportion of genes considered &#x201C;<italic>in planta</italic> only&#x201D;; 99 out of 244 or 41% were positively regulated and another nine (3.7%) were negatively regulated.</p>
        <p>Fgp1 positively regulates thirteen &#x201C;<italic>in planta</italic> only&#x201D; genes in putrescine as well as in wheat heads. Among these thirteen are six genes from the trichothecene biosynthetic cluster (FGSG_03534, FGSG_03536, FGSG_03537, FGSG_03538, FGSG_03540 and FGSG_03543) as well as four other genes involved in trichothecene toxin synthesis or co-expressed with <italic>TRI5</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Gardiner2">[24]</xref> (FGSG_00007, FGSG_01819, FGSG_07562 and FGSG_10397). Among the remaining three are FGSG_08079 a gene involved in butenolide synthesis, FGSG_08309 encoding an ABC transporter with orthologs in other fungi and FGSG_02120 for which there is no annotated function or ortholog found in any other fungi with a sequenced genome. Fgp1 negatively regulates one &#x201C;<italic>in planta</italic> only&#x201D; gene expressed in putrescine medium and during infection: FGSG_11033.</p>
        <p><italic>TRI6</italic> (FGSG_03536) encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of other <italic>TRI</italic> genes and genes involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. Since <italic>TRI6</italic> and an ancillary transcription factor, <italic>TRI10</italic>, are both extremely down-regulated in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain, genes positively regulated by Tri6 and Tri10 might be expected to be expressed at lower levels in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain. Indeed, 56 and 62 genes expressed at lower levels in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain in putrescine and wheat head, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s012">Table S5</xref>), were also found to be expressed at lower levels in the &#x394;<italic>tri6</italic>/<italic>tri10</italic> strains 96 h after wheat inoculation. Among the common regulated genes are the ones involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. This suggests that Fgp1 may assume a portion of its regulatory control by acting upstream of the Tri6 and Tri10 transcription factors.</p>

Fgp1 negatively regulates two of the 19 genes: FGSG_01832 and FGSG_03132.

In the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain, the aurofusarin cluster genes are up-regulated when compared to wild type suggesting a role for Fgp1 in the negative regulatory control of this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

        <p>To determine whether Fgp1 and Sge1 share common regulatory targets, a comparative transcriptional study was conducted during growth in culture. Both wild type strains <italic>Fol</italic>4287 and PH-1 as well as deletion strains &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, respectively, were grown in complete medium (CM) for 48 h. RNA was extracted, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, labeled and hybridized to microarray chips. In <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, 119 genes show a &#x2265;2 fold lower expression in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain on CM and 83 genes a higher expression compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s014">Table S7</xref>). For <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, 394 genes show a &#x2265;2 fold lower expression in the &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> strain on CM and 819 a higher expression compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s014">Table S7</xref>). When the gene sets regulated by either Fgp1 or Sge1 were compared, only a few orthologous genes were found to be regulated by both Sge1 and Fgp1 in the two <italic>Fusarium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s006">Figure S6</xref>). A set of 16 down-regulated and eight up-regulated orthologous genes were found in both deletion strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s015">Table S8</xref>). Remarkably, eleven genes up-regulated in &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> were found down-regulated in &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and one gene up-regulated in &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> was found down-regulated in &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> (data not shown). Altogether, the results from this comparative transcriptomic experiment suggest that Fgp1 and Sge1 regulate largely non-overlapping sets of genes.</p>
        <p>Because of the effect of the &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> mutation on sporulation in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> it was noteworthy that there was differential regulation between wild type and the &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> mutant for several genes known to effect sporulation in <italic>Fusarium</italic> and other fungi. <italic>REN1</italic>

The lower expression of these genes could account for the fewer number of spores produced by the &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref>. <italic>F. graminearum</italic> does not produce conidia in CM, so, in order to study these genes, we grew wild type and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> in liquid carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) medium or mung bean agar (MBA), two media that induce sporulation. Quantitative PCR experiments were conducted using cDNA obtained from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> wild type and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> wild type and &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> strains during growth in conidia inducing medium.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Jonkers1">[36]</xref> as a reference in both <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.

However, the expression of FGSG_ 07052 was lower in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain compared to wild type when grown on CM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These results suggest that Sge1 regulates a number of sporulation genes and that Fgp1 only regulates Aba1 during conidia formation. This expression difference may be attributable to the difference in spores that are formed under these conditions: microconidia in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> versus macroconidia in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.</p>

        <p>This observation led to the hypothesis that the functional specificity of the protein may be present in the highly diverged C-terminal portion of the protein. To test this, combinations of the two genes from <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic> were made and transformed into a &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and into a &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> strain of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. A combination consisting of the N-terminal portion of Fgp1 (amino acids (aa) 1&#x2013;219) and the C-terminal of Sge1 (aa 220&#x2013;330), expressed from the native <italic>FGP1</italic> promoter was used to complement the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strain. The strains obtained showed less spread (p&#x2264;0.01, Student's t-Test) and disease in inoculated wheat spikelets after two weeks compared to the full length <italic>FGP1</italic> complements but more disease than complements with full length <italic>SGE1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002724-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, bars below the <italic>FGP1</italic>/<italic>SGE1</italic> box). This suggests that the highly diverged C-terminus of Fgp1 is required for full function in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, the Wor1-like protein Fgp1 from <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was demonstrated to greatly influence plant infection and trichothecene mycotoxin production. The Fgp1 ortholog Wor1 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> also regulates pathogenicity by controlling dimorphic switching essential for mammalian infection. By analogy we hypothesize that Fgp1 and other orthologs like Sge1 (<italic>F. oxysporum</italic>) and Reg1 (<italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>) in phytopathogenic fungi may also act as master regulators of plant infection. Deletion of the <italic>WOR1</italic> orthologs in these fungi does not cause obvious vegetative growth defects yet the deletions appear to lock the mutants in a nonpathogenic state. Since the diseases caused by these fungi are vastly different in their mechanisms of infection, pathogenesis and tissue- and host specificity, the orthologous Wor1 regulatory proteins must also have evolved to regulate these unique aspects of their disease causing ability.</p>

        <title>Fgp1 regulates the production of trichothecene toxins</title>
        <p>This study is the first to demonstrate that a Wor-1 like protein has the ability to control the expression of genes for mycotoxin biosynthesis and well as other gene clusters for synthesis of fungal secondary metabolites such as aurofusarin and butenolide. Fgp1 positively regulates the <italic>TRI</italic> cluster but negatively the <italic>AUR</italic> cluster responsible for aurofusarin production. This phenotype is also seen in a heterochromatin protein encoding gene deletion mutant of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, &#x394;<italic>hep1</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-ReyesDominguez1">[37]</xref>. The similarity in phenotype between &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> and &#x394;<italic>hep1</italic> could suggest that Fgp1 regulates chromatin modification too. Trichothecene toxins produced by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> are central to its pathogenicity to wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Maier1">[21]</xref>. These toxins normally are synthesized during pathogenic growth and are induced within specific plant parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Ilgen1">[3]</xref>. As trichothecene biosynthesis is strongly under the control of Fgp1, especially through the transcription factor genes <italic>TRI6</italic> and <italic>TRI10</italic>, the protein must have evolved to regulate the genes for mycotoxin synthesis that are peculiar to this disease. A morphological change that accompanies trichothecene accumulation and gene expression is noticeably altered in the &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> mutant, suggesting that Fgp1 may be involved in a morphological change required for pathogenicity. A similar morphological change occurs during infection of wheat; <italic>in planta</italic>, <italic>F. graminearum</italic> forms thickened hyphae and coralloid structures that resemble the bulbous hyphae that are observed in putrescine medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Rittenour1">[38]</xref>.

        <title>Fgp1 regulates many genes during different growth conditions</title>
        <p>Using microarray analysis many putative downstream targets of Fgp1 were identified. Among these are several pathogenicity related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Lysoe1">[26]</xref>, including ones previously described as infection specific, such as genes from the <italic>TRI</italic> cluster and others involved in toxin production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Gardiner2">[24]</xref>. We also found many putative downstream targets of Fgp1 and of its <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> counterpart Sge1 when grown on CM. Both proteins show a high degree of specificity towards their putative targets as very little overlap was found between orthologous genes in the two species regulated by either Fgp1 or Sge1. Additionally, of the hundreds of genes that are regulated by &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> in putrescine medium and during wheat infection, only eight are also regulated by Fgp1 during growth in CM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002724.s016">Table S9</xref>), suggesting that Fgp1 regulates specific sets of genes during toxin induction conditions (putrescine or wheat head) or during growth in rich, toxin non-inducing medium (CM).</p>
        <p>A few target genes of Sge1 and Fgp1 identified in this study and confirmed by quantative PCR analysis, are involved in sporulation and some may also play a role during pathogenicity. For example, Sge1 regulates the expression level of <italic>REN1</italic>, a conserved gene required for adherence, biofilm formation and virulence in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Gravelat1">[41]</xref> and absolutely required for microconidia formation but not for pathogenicity in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Ohara1">[32]</xref>. The lower expression level of <italic>REN1</italic> in &#x394;<italic>sge1</italic> might explain, at least partly, the lower number of microconidia produced in CM. <italic>F. graminearum</italic> does not produce microconidia under any condition tested and perhaps as a consequence, no difference in <italic>REN1</italic> expression is observed between wild type and &#x394;<italic>fgp1</italic> strains during macroconidia formation. Sge1 also regulates the expression level of <italic>ABA1</italic>, another gene involved in conidium formation. In <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>melonis</italic>, a pathogen of melon, Aba1 regulates production of both micro- and macroconidia and is required for full virulence. The &#x394;<italic>aba1</italic> mutant of this strain shows delayed pathogenicity towards melon probably due to fewer spores produced inside the xylem vessels (personal communication Dr. Tsutomu Arie, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan). In addition to sporulation, the Aba1 ortholog in <italic>Penicillium marneffei</italic> is involved in the dimorphic switch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Borneman1">[42]</xref> and in <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> in autolysis and cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Tao1">[43]</xref>. The expression levels of <italic>ABA1</italic> of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> are also regulated by Fgp1 during conidia formation but not during growth in putrescine medium or infection of wheat heads. The role of <italic>ABA1</italic> during infection is therefore still elusive. Another gene known to control conidia formation in fungi that is regulated by Sge1 is FlbC. In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, FlbC regulates the developmental processes of conidia formation and sexual fruiting and is required for normal vegetative growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Kwon1">[35]</xref>. To the contrary, we found that Fgp1 does not regulate the expression of <italic>FLBC</italic> of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> during conidia formation. Instead we found that expression of <italic>FLBC</italic> is regulated by Fgp1 during growth on CM and putrescine medium. Interestingly, FlbC in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is absolutely required for wheat infection but not for toxin production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Son1">[44]</xref>. How FlbC regulates virulence independent of toxin production and whether and how <italic>FLBC</italic> is regulated by Fgp1 during wheat infection is not yet known. <italic>FLBC</italic> is an interesting candidate gene to investigate further regarding its role in pathogenicity and its putative function downstream of both Fgp1 and Sge1.</p>
        <p>A transcription factor not involved in sporulation but nevertheless regulated both by Fgp1 and Sge1 during growth on CM is DAL81. Dal81 is a general activator of nitrogen metabolic genes in yeast, including those for &#x3B3;-aminobutyrate (GABA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Sylvain1">[45]</xref>. Its exact role in <italic>Fusarium</italic> species is not yet known but this transcription factor (FGSG_02068) is required for toxin production in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> but, paradoxically, apparently not for virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Son1">[44]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Whether Fgp1 and Sge1 are transcription factors and bind DNA directly is not known.

However, a search conducted for these patterns in upstream regions in both the genomes did not unveil any enrichment for this pattern in the genes found up- or down-regulated by either Sge1 or Fgp1 (data not shown).

        <title>Presence of WOR1-like genes in fungi</title>
        <p>The evolution of the Wor1-like proteins involved a duplication of the ancestral <italic>Wor1</italic> like gene sequence prior to the divergence of the yeast -like and filamentous ascomycetous fungi. The duplication resulted in paralogous genes (<italic>FGP1</italic>/<italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>FGP2</italic>/<italic>PAC2</italic>) that apparently have evolved quite different regulatory functions. While <italic>FGP2</italic>/<italic>PAC2</italic> orthologs have been shown to be dispensable for pathogenicity, several studies now have established a role for <italic>FGP1</italic>/<italic>WOR1</italic> in pathogenicity for a surprisingly diverse array of fungal pathogens of both plants and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Michielse3">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Nguyen1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Huang1">[12]</xref>. The function of <italic>FGP1</italic>/<italic>WOR1</italic> however, clearly extends beyond its role in pathogenicity since transcriptome studies demonstrate its regulatory control over many other functions such as reproduction and secondary metabolism. <italic>FGP1</italic>/<italic>WOR1</italic> and <italic>FGP2</italic>/<italic>PAC2</italic> orthologs also are found in strictly non-pathogenic fungi like <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> (data not shown); however, interestingly, in the non-pathogenic fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> only the <italic>FGP2</italic>/<italic>PAC2</italic> ortholog is present.</p>
        <p>Unlike the N-termini, the divergent glutamine-rich C-termini of <italic>FGP1/WOR1</italic> genes in <italic>Fusarium</italic> likely allow specificity of regulatory control that has evolved independently in each species. Indeed the sets of genes regulated by orthologs <italic>FGP1</italic> and <italic>SGE1</italic> in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, respectively, show little overlap and swapping experiments indicate the function of the C-terminal domains is largely specific to the species of origin.</p>

In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, Wor1 phosphorylation and subsequent activation is believed to be performed by Tpk2, a subunit of the PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002724-Huang2">[19]</xref>.
