      <abstract>
        <p>The application of a new gene-based strategy for sequencing the wheat mitochondrial genome shows its structure to be a 452&#x2009;528 bp circular molecule, and provides nucleotide-level evidence of intra-molecular recombination. Single, reciprocal and double recombinant products, and the nucleotide sequences of the repeats that mediate their formation have been identified. The genome has 55 genes with exons, including 35 protein-coding, 3 rRNA and 17 tRNA genes. Nucleotide sequences of seven wheat genes have been determined here for the first time. Nine genes have an exon&#x2013;intron structure. Gene amplification responsible for the production of multicopy mitochondrial genes, in general, is species-specific, suggesting the recent origin of these genes. About 16, 17, 15, 3.0 and 0.2% of wheat mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may be of genic (including introns), open reading frame, repetitive sequence, chloroplast and retro-element origin, respectively. The gene order of the wheat mitochondrial gene map shows little synteny to the rice and maize maps, indicative that thorough gene shuffling occurred during speciation. Almost all unique mtDNA sequences of wheat, as compared with rice and maize mtDNAs, are redundant DNA. Features of the gene-based strategy are discussed, and a mechanistic model of mitochondrial gene amplification is proposed.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>The mitochondrial genome is important in plant development, as well as in productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), and extensive studies have been done on its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Although the complete nucleotide sequence has been determined for seven land plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), the genomic makeup is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) because of the multipartite structure of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). With a new gene-based strategy for sequencing the wheat mitochondrial genome, we obtained a number of recombinant molecules, analyses of which for the first time have provided proof, at the nucleotide sequence level, of the mechanism that produces multipartite molecules in the mitochondrial genome. Moreover, we demonstrate by gene map comparison that thorough gene shuffling occurred during the speciation of three cereals (wheat, rice and maize), leading to remarkable changes in their mitochondrial genome structures, as previously shown by the restriction fragment mapping of maize mitochondrial DNA (mtDNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and by MultiPipMaker analysis of several sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Based on this information, we propose a new method for quantifying genome-wide molecular changes in mitochondrial genomes, which result in ontogenetic as well as phylogenetic variability of the cereal mitochondrial genomes.</p>
      <p>In the wheat complex, <italic>Triticum</italic> (wheat) and <italic>Aegilops</italic> (goat grass), inter- as well as intra-specific molecular diversity of both the chloroplast and the mitochondrial genomes were studied in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of various taxa of the complex, including the origin of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Diversity among plasmons of their phenotypic effects on various wheat characters also was investigated [for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>)]. However, we have not studied the functional relationships between molecular variation and differential phenotypic effects. We determined recently the complete nucleotide sequence and gene content of the wheat chloroplast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Here we report those of the mitochondrial genome. The information obtained provides a basis for future studies on the linkage of molecular diversity and phenotypic variability in the wheat complex.</p>

        <p>The common wheat, <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cv. Chinese Spring, was the source of the mtDNA studied here, that was obtained from mitochondria of 14-day-old etiolated seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and was purified before use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p>

        <title>MtDNA library construction and clone sequencing</title>
        <p>An mtDNA library was constructed by the SuperCos1 <italic>in vitro</italic> packaging method (Stratagene, LaJolla) from partially digested wheat mtDNA with Sau3AI. From this library, 232 clones were randomly selected and dot-blotted with 32 mitochondrial genes as probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). All probe genes, except <italic>rps13</italic>, hybridized with 7 or more clones, from which 23 clones were selected to cover 31 probe genes and were sequenced by the shotgun method. Sequenced fragments were aligned using BLASTn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) to determine the entire sequence of each clone.</p>

        <title>Sequence assembly and gene analysis</title>
        <p>Alignment of the 23 clones gave two linear molecules of &#x223C;350 and 76 kb. Two additional clones, #194 and #204, whose ends hybridized to one end each of the two linear molecules, were selected and sequenced. Phrap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.washington.edu/UWGC/analysistools/phrap.htm"/>), BLASTn and blast2sequences programs were used for the primary assembly of all the clones. Manual fine tuning was done to generate the final master circle (MC). Repeat sequences were analyzed by in-house script, window size 8 bp, and represented as a dot-plot image. Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified by a Genome Gambler (Xanagen Co.) and ORFfinder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/"/>). tRNA genes were searched for by tRNAscan-SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The annotated rice and maize mitochondrial genes, BA000029 and AY506529, respectively, as well as individual wheat mitochondrial genes submitted to the DNA databank, were compared with our sequence data to annotate all the genes. Sequences homologous to known cereal transposable elements were searched for, referring to the TIGR grass transposable elements database after Clifton <italic>et al</italic>.

        <title>Sequencing of individual clones and their alignment</title>
        <p>Twenty-five wheat mtDNA clones were sequenced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Their sizes ranged from 27 to 44 kb, except for two (#27 and #39) &#x223C;16 kb in size. The average size was 34&#x2009;898 bp, and the total size was 872&#x2009;455 bp. Alignment showed a single 452&#x2009;528 bp MC molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Fifteen clones occupied single locations in the genome (&#x2018;intact clone&#x2019;), while the remaining 10 were split into two or three segments located in different parts of the genome, tentatively called the &#x2018;recombinant clone&#x2019;. Quetier <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) estimated size of the wheat mitochondrial genome to be &#x223C;430 kb, based on its SalI restriction map. Their estimate is very close to the size, 452&#x2009;528 bp, determined by the present sequencing work.</p>

        <title>Intra-molecular recombination and site of recombination</title>
        <p>Of the 10 recombinant clones, 8 were split into two segments. The other two (#24 and #224) were cleaved into three segments. Without exception, there was a pair of direct repeats (DRs) or inverted repeats (IRs) at the split site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All the recombinant clones carried a completely or nearly identical copy of the same repeat at the recombination site (details in the next paragraph). DRs connected split fragments head-to-tail, whereas IRs connected them head-to-head or tail-to-tail. These facts indicate that the split clones were produced by intra-molecular recombination between the relevant repeats. In sum, nine repeat pairs, R1 to R9, were responsible for the production of all of the recombinant clones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The production of clones #24 and #51 was mediated by the same R7 repeats, whereas #75 (#162 as well) and #96 were reciprocal products of recombination of R8 repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Two clones, #24 and #224, were double recombinants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The former was produced by recombination between two DR pairs, R3 and R7, and the latter recombination between two IR pairs, R2 and R6. Seven additional repeats, R10 to R16, larger than 100 bp were present in the genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Three repeats, R1, R7 and R10, shared a 1634 bp sequence in common, containing a part of <italic>rrn26</italic>. Similarly, three other repeats, R2, R3 and R4, shared a 4430 bp common sequence that carried <italic>trnfM</italic>, <italic>rrn18</italic> and <italic>rrn5</italic>. In addition, small repeats of 30&#x2013;100 bp in size were detected in a dot-matrix image, of which 35 were the direct and 38 were the inverted types. All those repeats are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, in which R1 to R16 are marked by arrows. We need to search for whether all of them serve as recombination sites or not, although our results showed that a repeat pair as small as 197 bp in size (= R9) mediated recombination.</p>
        <p>We tried to identify the recombination site in each repeat pair. Four, R3, R5, R6 and R7, had identical copies. Four others, R1, R2, R4 and R9, had only 1 nt difference between the two copies, located at the extreme end of the repeat (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Identification of the recombination site therefore was informative only for repeat pair R8, which was involved in the production of three recombinant clones; #75, #96 and #162 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Two copies of this repeat, R8-1 and -2, which carried <italic>atp6-1</italic> and <italic>atp6-2</italic> at the same R8 coordinates, 91&#x2013;1251, had 8 nt differences; one at R8 coordinate 6, the others between coordinates 1301 and 1316 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Nucleotide sequences of the two R8 copies and their 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;-flanking segments were compared with those of the three recombinants. As for the 5&#x2032;-flanking sequence and sixth nucleotide of R8, #75 and #162 were the same as the R8-1 copy, whereas #96 was the same as R8-2. As for the 3&#x2032;-flanking sequence and seven variable nucleotides at R8 coordinates 1301&#x2013;1316, #75 and #162 were the same as the R8-2 copy, whereas #96 was identical to the R8-1 copy. These findings indicate that all three recombinant clones were produced by recombination in the same 1294 bp segment of the R8 repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Previously, Bonen and Bird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) sequenced wheat mtDNA segments flanking <italic>atp6</italic>, and found that there are two molecular forms at both the 5&#x2032; (&#x2018;downstream&#x2019; in their designation) and 3&#x2032; (&#x2018;upstream&#x2019;) borders of the gene. Their nucleotide sequences were in complete agreement with ours, except for a 1 bp deletion in our R8-2 copy between MC coordinates 86&#x2009;217 and 86&#x2009;218. Their sequences 3 and 2 correspond to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; borders of the R8-1 copy, and the sequences 4 and 1 to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; borders of the R8-2 copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). They located a 6 bp insertion in sequence 3, extending the homologous region between sequences 3 and 4 by 22 bp downstream (toward the 5&#x2032; end), which was confirmed by our findings. The sequence comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) indicated that the three recombinant clones were produced by recombination in the same 1291 bp segment (3 bp smaller, comparing with the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Because this segment occupies &#x223C;95% of the R8 repeat, it is not surprising that three independent recombination events occurred within this segment.</p>
        <p>Bonen and Bird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) also reported the presence of short DRs in three of the above four sequences, corresponding to the present 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; borders of the R8-1 copy and the 5&#x2032; border of the R8-2 copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), where &#x2018;border&#x2019; means the boundary between a repeat end and its flanking sequence. We examined 60 bp sequences around the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; borders (30 bp on both sides of each border) of all repeats shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. The complete border sequences are given in Supplementary Table 1. Of 70 border sequences of the 35 repeat copies, 22 contained straight, DRs (no gap, no mismatch) of 3&#x2013;7 bp while additional 24 possessed aberrant 4&#x2013;10 bp DRs, having a mismatched nucleotide or a few nucleotides intervening between the repeats, and the remaining 24 did not have short DRs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Fourteen repeats had short DRs at both ends, which did not show any sequence similarity, homologous or complementary, to each other. Thus, we conclude that the majority of the repeat ends are associated with short DRs, although their functional role is unknown.</p>
        <p>Stern and Palmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) indicated that <italic>rrn18</italic> and <italic>rrn26</italic> often are contained in recombination sites of the wheat mitochondrial genome. Our results confirmed this because 6 of the 12 recombination events detected are mediated by repeat pairs containing those genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Genes and the genetic map of the wheat mitochondrial genome</title>
        <p>In all, 55 genes and their exons were identified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>) and mapped on the MC molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). All the protein-, rRNA- and tRNA-coding genes known for wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) were present, i.e. 9 Complex I genes, 1 Complex III gene, 3 Complex IV genes, 5 Complex V genes, 4 cytochrome c biogenesis genes, 11 ribosomal protein genes, 2 other protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA genes and 17 tRNA genes. Nucleotide sequences of seven wheat genes, <italic>rpl16, rps3, rps4, mttB, trnA, trnI</italic> and <italic>trnM</italic>, were determined here for the first time. Three genes, <italic>rpl2-p</italic>, <italic>rps19-p</italic>, and <italic>rrn26-p</italic> (the third <italic>rrn26</italic> copy), were truncated. The first two are functional in rice but missing in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Nine genes, <italic>nad1</italic>, <italic>nad2</italic>, <italic>nad4</italic>, <italic>nad5</italic>, <italic>nad7</italic>, <italic>cox2</italic>, <italic>ccmFC</italic>, <italic>rps3</italic> and <italic>trnA</italic> (chloroplast origin), had the exon&#x2013;intron structure. The chloroplast counterpart of <italic>trnA</italic> also has an intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). All exons of <italic>nad4</italic> (exons <italic>a-d</italic>), <italic>nad7</italic> (<italic>a-e</italic>), <italic>cox2</italic> (<italic>a,b</italic>), <italic>ccmC</italic> (<italic>a</italic>,<italic>b</italic>), <italic>rps3</italic> (<italic>a,b</italic>) and <italic>trnA</italic> (<italic>5</italic>&#x2032;-,<italic>3</italic>&#x2032;-<italic>ex</italic>) were <italic>cis</italic>-spliced, whereas some exons of <italic>nad1</italic>, <italic>nad2</italic> and <italic>nad5</italic>, were <italic>trans</italic>-spliced (the slash indicating <italic>trans</italic>-spliced exons) as follows: <italic>nad1a</italic>/<italic>nad1b,c</italic>/<italic>nad1d</italic>/<italic>nad1e</italic>; <italic>nad2a,b</italic>/<italic>nad2c-e</italic>; and <italic>nad5a,b</italic>/<italic>nad5c</italic>/<italic>nad5d,e</italic>.</p>
        <p>Ten genes were present in multi-copy: <italic>atp6</italic>, <italic>atp8</italic>, <italic>rrn26</italic>, <italic>trnD</italic> and <italic>trnP</italic> were duplicated and <italic>rrn5</italic>, <italic>rrn18</italic>, <italic>trnfM</italic>, <italic>trnK</italic> and <italic>trnQ</italic> triplicated. In addition, three <italic>trnS</italic> genes were found, but they greatly differed each other in nucleotide sequence and therefore were considered different genes, confirming the results of two previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p>
        <p>Restriction fragment analyses of wheat mtDNA revealed the presence of seven molecular forms of the <italic>rrn18-rrn5</italic> cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). We identified three copies, Copy-1, -2 and -3, of a three-gene cluster, <italic>trnfM-rrn18-rrn5</italic>, in the MC molecule, all of which were included in three repeats, R2, R3 and R4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the production of two recombinant forms of this gene cluster from recombination between Copy-1 and -2 (pathway [A]) and Copy-2 and -3 (pathway [B]). Because recombination also occurs between Copy-1 and -3, six recombinants are expected altogether. We obtained three of them, which were produced by recombination between Copy-1 and -2 (#1L/R), Copy-1 and -3 (#224C/R) and Copy-2 and -3 (#24C/L) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). None of their reciprocal products was obtained, probably as a matter of chance owing to the small number of the clones examined, because the fourth recombinant molecule is reported by Lejeune <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). As for <italic>rrn26</italic>, two molecular forms of its 5&#x2032; end, and three forms of the 3&#x2032; end had been predicted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). This prediction was verified by the present findings confirming two complete and one partial copy (422 bp 3&#x2032; end) of <italic>rrn26</italic>.</p>
        <p>Two copies of <italic>atp8</italic> had five mismatched nucleotide pairs scattered within the 471 bp gene region. Sequence analyses of recombinant molecules supposedly produced by recombination between the R11 repeats containing this gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) might be useful in specifying recombination site(s) within the repeat.</p>
        <p>In addition to those genes, 179 ORFs larger than 300 bp were found (Supplementary Table 2). Their total size amounted to 75&#x2009;465 bp, occupying &#x223C;16.7% of the entire genome. This number greatly exceeds the 121 ORFs of comparable size reported for maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), in spite of the fact that the wheat mitochondrial genome is much smaller than the maize genome. Functional analysis of those ORFs will be an important problem in the future mitochondrial genomics.</p>

        <title>MtDNA sequences homologous to ctDNA</title>
        <p>Homology search using the blast2sequence program revealed that the wheat mitochondrial genome has 55 sequences homologous (mostly with 80% or higher homology on the nucleotide basis) to the corresponding sequences of the wheat chloroplast genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Exceptions were nine sequences question-marked in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>, which were mosaic of highly conserved and variable sequences, showing segmental differentiation of the sequences. Sizes of individual sequences vary between 27 bp for the smallest and 4239 bp for the largest. The total size, 26&#x2009;264 bp, corresponds to 5.80% of the entire genome.</p>
        <p>Of the above 55 wheat mtDNA sequences, 8 carried native (not chloroplast-derived) mitochondrial genes, <italic>atp1, rrn18-1, -2, -3, rrn26-1, -2, -p</italic> and <italic>trnM</italic>, whose total size amounted to 12&#x2009;809 bp. They showed homology to the ctDNA sequences carrying the corresponding chloroplast genes, <italic>atpA, rrn16, rrn23</italic> and <italic>trnM</italic> (marked by circles in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Each of the gene pairs, <italic>atp1/atpA</italic>, <italic>rrn18/rrn16</italic>, <italic>rrn26/rrn23</italic> and mt-<italic>trnM</italic>/ct-<italic>trnM</italic>, is assumed to have originated from a common prokaryotic gene, being homoeologous to each other (evidence will be reported elsewhere). The total size of the mtDNA sequences of real chloroplast origin therefore was estimated as 13&#x2009;455 bp; 2.97% of the wheat mitochondrial genome, compared with 22&#x2009;593 bp (6.3%) and 25&#x2009;281 bp (4.4%) reported, respectively, for rice and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Thus, both the total size and proportion of the chloroplast-derived sequences relative to the entire genome were smallest in wheat, comparing with rice and maize.</p>

        <title>Gene shuffling in the cereal mitochondrial genome</title>
        <p>We compared mitochondrial gene maps of wheat, rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), excluding tRNA genes, pseudogenes and ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Five exons of <italic>nad7</italic>, <italic>nad7a</italic> to <italic>e</italic>, showed a common arrangement in the three cereals. This gene was used to mark the common map origin, and the arrangement of <italic>nad7a</italic> to <italic>nad7e</italic> to mark the common map direction. A syntenic gene/exon arrangement, then, should appear as a row of genes/exons parallel to either diagonal line. Only a few gene/exon clusters of the three cereals showed synteny. One 5-gene cluster, <italic>ccmFN-rps1-matR-nad1e-nad5c</italic>, and five 2-gene clusters, <italic>rps13-nad1bc</italic>, <italic>rrn18-rrn5</italic>, <italic>rps3-rpl16, nad9-nad2cde</italic> and <italic>nad3-rps12</italic>, showed synteny. The third and fourth ones are shown as 3-gene clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, because maize has an extra copy of both <italic>rps3a</italic> and <italic>nad2de</italic> and, for this, <italic>rps3a</italic> and <italic>rps3bcd</italic>, and <italic>nad2c</italic> and <italic>nad2de</italic> were shown separately. Similarly, <italic>nad4abc</italic> and <italic>nad4d</italic> were shown as a 2-gene cluster because rice has two extra copies of <italic>nad4d</italic>. In addition, three 2-gene clusters, <italic>rps19(p)-nad4L</italic>, <italic>ccmB-nad2ab</italic> and <italic>nad5ab-rpl2(p)</italic>, of wheat and rice conserved synteny, and two 2-gene clusters (<italic>cox1-rrn26</italic> and <italic>nad6-rps4</italic>) of wheat and maize preserved synteny. No synteny was detected for any other gene combinations, indicative that frequent gene shuffling occurred during cereal speciation, resulting in remarkable structural differences in the cereal's mitochondrial genomes. Fauron <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) showed by the physical map comparison that mitochondrial genome restructuring has taken place between three maize cytotypes, and Clifton <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) demonstrated by MultiPipMaker analysis that little sequence similarity exists between mitochondrial genomes of six plant species. Those results agree with ours of the above cereal gene map comparison.</p>

        <title>Features of the gene-based strategy for sequencing plant mitochondrial genomes</title>
        <p>Two principal strategies have been used to sequence plant mitochondrial genomes; the physical map-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), and the genome shotgun strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). We used a new gene-based strategy for wheat, facilitated by the fact that many wheat mitochondrial genes are available as probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) for selecting wheat mtDNA clones for sequencing. Use of this strategy gave a complete picture of the wheat mitochondrial genome by sequencing the 872.5 kb mtDNA, less than twice the genome size, 452&#x2009;528 bp. Comparative values for the genome shotgun strategy are &#x223C;4, 8 and &gt;20 times for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, tobacco and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), indicating apparent high genome sequencing efficiency of the gene-based strategy. However, application of this strategy requires construction of a cosmid mtDNA library and selection of mtDNA clones covering known mitochondrial genes by dot hybridization. The overall efficiency of the gene-based strategy, compared with that of the genome shotgun strategy, is not clear.</p>
        <p>The advantage of the gene-based, compared with the physical map-based strategy, is that no physical map construction is required. This is difficult with some plants because of the multipartite structure of the mitochondrial genome. Based on the physical map of the mitochondrial genome of a common wheat cultivar, Capitole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), Lejeune and Quetier [cited from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>)] constructed the first gene map of the wheat mitochondrial genome, to which 36 genes were allocated. Their map completely matches ours for five local gene maps: (i) <italic>rrn18/rrn5</italic>&#x2013;<italic>cob</italic>&#x2013;<italic>atp6</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad5de</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad4abcd</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad2ab</italic>&#x2013;<italic>orf25</italic> (= <italic>atp4</italic>)&#x2013;<italic>nad2cde</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad9</italic>&#x2013;<italic>cox2ab</italic>&#x2013;<italic>cox1</italic>&#x2013;<italic>rrn26</italic>, (ii) <italic>rps7</italic>&#x2013; <italic>rrn18/rrn5</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad7abcde</italic>&#x2013;<italic>atp1</italic>&#x2013;<italic>atp9</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad1bc</italic>&#x2013;<italic>rps13</italic>&#x2013;<italic>atp6</italic>&#x2013;<italic>cox3</italic>, (iii) <italic>nad1a</italic>&#x2013;<italic>rrn18/rrn5</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad5ab</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad1d</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad6</italic>&#x2013;<italic>rrn26</italic>, (iv) <italic>nad3</italic>&#x2013;<italic>rps12</italic>&#x2013;<italic>orf156</italic> (= <italic>atp8</italic>) and (v) <italic>matR</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad1e</italic>&#x2013;<italic>nad5c</italic>. The arrangement of these five gene groups within the genome, however, differ both in order and direction. Their order in Lejeune and Quetier's map is that shown above, whereas in our map it is (i)&#x2013;(iii, reverted)&#x2013;(iv, reverted)&#x2013;(ii)&#x2013;(v, reverted). Whether this discrepancy is due to the different mtDNA sources, or to problems in the physical map they relied upon, needs to be clarified.</p>
        <p>The gene-based strategy for complete mitochondrial genome sequencing can not achieve its goal by itself if the genome contains large gene-free region(s) of &gt;35 kb (average insert size of the vector) when Cosmid mtDNA clones are used in sequencing. To cover such regions of the genome, we need to perform sequencing of some additional clones which do not carry any probe genes. In fact, it was necessary for us to sequence a probe gene-free clone, #194, to complete sequencing the wheat mitochondrial genome. The MC molecule obtained successfully integrated all sequenced mtDNAs in it without leaving any pieces out.</p>
        <p>Blast search on the sequence homology between the present wheat and previously reported rice and maize mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) provided supporting evidence that the present MC molecule represents the wheat mitochondrial genome. The rice and maize mitochondrial genomes were divided into successive 30 kb sections (sizes of the end sections were somewhat different), and sequences homologous to wheat mtDNA were investigated for each section (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">Table 6</xref>). All the sections contained homologous sequences of &#x223C;3 kb or larger (up to 15 kb) to wheat mtDNA. MtDNA sequences conserved between wheat and rice, and between wheat and maize were distributed all over the rice and maize genomes, with no large conserved sequence-free regions (larger than 10 kb; detailed data omitted) in the genomes. This fact indicates that rice and maize mitochondrial genomic sequences are well represented in the wheat MC molecule.</p>
        <p>The most essential feature of the present gene-based strategy is that it facilitated the recovery of recombinant molecules. Restriction fragment mapping of plant mtDNA shows a multipartite structure of the mitochondrial genome, consisting of isomeric as well as subgenomic molecules produced by intra-molecular recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). None of the previous works on complete sequencing of flowering plant mitochondrial genomes, by use of either the genome shotgun or physical map-based strategies, has recovered recombinant molecules. This is why recombination events have not been analyzed at the nucleotide sequence level. By virtue of the gene-based strategy, we obtained 10 recombinant clones among 25 examined, determined their nucleotide sequences, and identified repeat sequences responsible for their formation.</p>

        <title>Structural features of the wheat mitochondrial genome</title>
        <p>The wheat mitochondrial genome was assumed to be a 452&#x2009;528 bp MC molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), that was &#x223C;92 and 79% the size of the rice and maize mitochondrial genomes, and possessed all the protein-, rRNA- and tRNA-coding genes known to be present in rice and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). These facts indicate that wheat has the most compact mitochondrial genome among the three cereals.</p>
        <p>Multicopy mitochondrial genes were compared between wheat, rice and maize (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Table 7</xref>). Gene amplification in general was species-specific. All of the multicopy wheat genes were located in the repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). With the exceptions of <italic>atp8</italic> and <italic>trnQ</italic>, multicopies of all the wheat genes had identical nucleotide sequences. As for <italic>trnQ</italic>, two copies were identical, whereas the third copy differed from them by a single nucleotide. These facts suggest their recent amplification, comparing with the divergence time of three cereals. One alternative possibility is copy correction through homologous recombination, which is known to occur in the case of chloroplast IRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p>
        <p>To account for the observed species-specific gene amplification, a mechanistic model can be proposed. Recombination between the same repeat sequences in two subgenomic molecules produced by recombination between different repeat pairs will give rise to an aberrant MC molecule having a duplicate segment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> illustrates an example, using a simplified MC molecule, in which only three copies (Copy-1, -2 and -3) of the <italic>trnfM-rrn18-rrn5</italic> cluster and two repeat pairs, R5 and R6, are shown. Recombination between the R6 sequences in two subgenomic molecules, II and III, which are produced in pathways [B] and [C], gives a new MC molecule with an extra copy of the <italic>trnfM-rrn18-rrn5</italic> cluster and R5 repeat together with their flanking regions. The size of the duplication corresponds to the sum of two segments, one between the recombination breakpoints in Copy-2 and one R5 copy, and the other between those in Copy-3 and the other R5 copy.</p>
        <p>Search for transposable element sequences in the wheat mitochondrial genome revealed presence of five sequences, three of which were different partial sequences of the wheat Sabrina retrotransposon, and two others were a part of a rice Tos-14 retrotransposon and wheat Tar1 retrotransposon. Total size of the five sequences was 805 bp, being &#x223C;0.2% of the mitochondrial genome. Comparable figures for rice and maize were 20 sequences (total size 7003 bp, 14.3% of the genome) and 4 sequences (total size 641 bp, 0.1% of the genome), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In this respect, wheat mitochondrial genome is similar to maize than to rice mitochondrial genome.</p>
        <p>It is important to know what kinds of sequences were involved in the observed mitochondrial genome differentiation. For this purpose, the MC coordinates of all unique wheat sequences larger than 100 bp, comparing with both the rice and maize mtDNA sequences were enumerated (Supplementary Table 3). In total, 227 unique sequences distributed throughout the genome were identified. Comparison between their positions and those of all mitochondrial genes in the genome indicated that almost all unique sequences corresponded to intergenic spaces. The exceptions were nine sequences carrying partial sequence of a gene. Of those, six sequences carried 3&#x2013;97 bp of the highly variable 3&#x2032; end of the sense strand of <italic>cob, nad6, rpl2-p, rrn5-1</italic>, <italic>rrn5-2</italic> and <italic>rrn5-3</italic>. Two sequences contained a 324 bp segment of <italic>atp6-1</italic> and -<italic>2</italic>, that is located in the 3&#x2032;-terminal region of these genes. The last sequence carried a 28 bp 5&#x2032; end of <italic>nad9</italic>, that is variable among the three cereals. These facts taken together demonstrate that the mtDNA sequences diversified in the three cereals are mostly redundant DNAs.</p>
        <p>In a summary, the wheat mtDNA sequences were partitioned into six categories, genic (including introns), ORF, repetitive, chloroplast-derived, retro-element and unique sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">Table 8</xref>). This partition was not orthogonal, because some sequences were enumerated in more than one category. Sizes of the genic, ORF, repetitive, chloroplast-derived and unique sequences were obtained from the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>, Supplementary Table 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> and Supplementary Table 3, respectively.</p>

        <title>Structural dynamics of the mitochondrial genome in ontogeny</title>
        <p>Arrieta-Montiel <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) reported on the structural dynamics of the common bean mitochondrial genome, which was revealed by studying a single mtDNA segment carrying the cms-associated <italic>pvs-orf239</italic> sequence. Using the gene-based strategy, we isolated 10 recombinant mtDNA molecules, and determined the repeat sequences responsible for their production. Many other repeat pairs also were characterized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which are potential sites for additional recombination. Based on the entire wheat mitochondrial genome sequence (DNA Database accession no. AP008982) and the map positions of all repeat pairs larger than 100 bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), we may prepare DNA primers for the sequences flanking both ends of those repeats. Their use in long-range PCR will allow efficient screening of recombinant molecules produced by recombination between the marked repeat pairs and quantification of isomeric as well as subgenomic molecules, as proved by Sugiyama <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) in tobacco. They also demonstrated that long-range PCR works for a distance as long as 23 kb between two primers, which is sufficient to cover all repeats present in the wheat mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The same method may also facilitate finding the difference in recombinational activity among various repeat pairs as well as the equality or inequality of the reciprocal recombination products.</p>
        <p>The methodological details for such studies are as follows: recombination between an IR pair will produce an isomer (flop form) of the MC molecule (flip form; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, pathway [A]). This event is detected by long-range PCR using four primer pairs, A/B, C/D, A/D and C/B. If either the A/B or C/D primer pair gives an amplified product in PCR, the template clone is regarded as the original MC molecule, whereas if either the A/D or C/B pair gives an amplified product, the template clone is regarded as the flop configuration of MC, so far as the marked IR is concerned. The ratio of the latter to the former clones in number gives the molar ratio of the recombinant to the non-recombinant clones. Similarly, recombination between a DR pair will produce two subgenomic molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, pathway [B]), whose production is detected by successful DNA amplification by use of the C/F or E/D primer pair. Quantification of the subgenomic molecules over the non-recombinants is achieved in the same way as described above. Such studies targeted to different repeat pairs enumerated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, using Cosmid clones of wheat mtDNA extracted from different organs or different ages of the plant as the template, will disclose structural dynamics of the mitochondrial genome in plant development.</p>

        <title>Evolutionary change in the mitochondrial genome structures of cereals</title>
        <p>The chloroplast genomes of rice, maize and wheat have identical gene arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), evidence of the structure's evolutionary stability. In contrast, the mitochondrial genome structure differs markedly in the three cereals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) although the kinds of genes present essentially are the same [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), present findings]. We showed that a variety of mtDNA molecules are produced in somatic tissues by intra-molecular recombination mediated by different repeat pairs. The structural differences of several mitochondrial genes in wheat and rice are suspected to be caused by short repeat pairs (data to be published elsewhere). We postulate that the same mechanism operates in germ cell lines, creating structural diversity in the mitochondrial genomes of different plant phylogenies.</p>
        <p>Another possible factor for high phylogenetic variability of the mitochondrial genome, compared with the chloroplast genome, is high DNA redundancy in the former than in the latter genome. The ratio of the genic sequences, including all exons and <italic>cis</italic>-introns, and excluding the sequences of chloroplast origin and pseudogenes, to the total mitochondrial genome size is 18.0% for rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), 11.7% for maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) and 15.9% for wheat (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">Table 8</xref>). Comparable values for the chloroplast genome are 58.8% for rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) and 60.4% for wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), indicative of the presence of a much larger amount of redundant DNAs in the mitochondrial than in the chloroplast genome.</p>

        <title>The MC molecule may represent the intact wheat mitochondrial genome</title>
        <p>All previous works on complete sequencing of flowering plant mitochondrial genomes are based upon the MC molecule hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Because of the multipartite structure of the genome and the lack of direct electron-microscopic evidence, however, the existence of the MC molecule is still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). After Andre <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), we suspected reality of the MC molecule in wheat and upon this suspicion we adopted the gene-based sequencing strategy. It turns out, however, that analysis of the 10 recombinant clones obtained has given support to the existence of the MC molecule.</p>
        <p>If we consider the MC molecule to be a flip configuration of the genome, then recombination between either of the three IR pairs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) will produce its flop (= isomeric) molecule, as shown in the pathway [A] of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, whereas recombination between either of the DR pairs produces two complementary, subgenomic molecules (pathways [B] and [C] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), where &#x2018;complementary&#x2019; means that a complete gene set is shared by two or more molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The origin of eight recombinant clones can be explained by a single recombination event, while the remaining two double-recombination events occurred in the MC molecule. However, if the genome were in any other configuration, most of the recombinant clones obtained could not have been produced by simple recombination events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl9">Table 9</xref>). Consider the following: if the genome existed in the flop configuration of MC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl9">Table 9</xref>, Case 1&#x2013;4), then recombination between any pair of the present DRs should produce double-flop configurations of the genome (Case 1 and 2), and recombination between IRs should produce two subgenomic molecules (Case 3 and 4). Similarly, if the genome consisted of two subgenomic molecules (Case 5&#x2013;8), recombination between the repeat sequences in two separated molecules should produce the MC molecule (Case 5 and 6), or its double-flop configuration (Case 7 and 8). In all eight postulated cases, the expected recombination products do not match the ones we actually obtained. This fact supports the hypothesis that the MC molecule serves as the basic wheat mitochondrial genome structure.</p>
        <p>A possible alternative is that the wheat mitochondrial genome contains all kinds of isomeric as well as subgenomic molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Lonsdale <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and Fauron <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) showed that 5&#x2013;14 subgenomic molecules are produced from the MC molecule of sugar beet and maize by intra-molecular recombination. In our study we prepared wheat mtDNA from 2-week-old seedlings. Now, if a seedling consists of &#x223C;10<sup>6</sup> cells, it means that 19 successive cell divisions, on the average, occurred before DNA extraction. We do not know how many replication origins exist in the wheat mitochondrial MC molecule. An electron-microscopic study of mtDNA replication in <italic>Chenopodium</italic> indicates only a few, if not just one, origins in its mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Considering this fact, together with information on the single replication origin of bacterial chromosomes, it is hard to believe that all kinds of subgenomic molecules have replication origins necessary for their maintenance through many cell cycles. This is further support for the presence of the MC molecule.</p>

          <p>Alignment of 25 mtDNA clones in the 452&#x2009;528 bp MC molecule of the wheat mitochondrial genome. Broad, light-green bar shows the MC molecule cleaved between MC coordinates 452&#x2009;528 and 1. Numbers on the MC molecule show the MC coordinates of the ends of all the clones, their segments and repeat sequences. Rectangle with projection in the broad bar: R1&#x2013;R9 repeat pairs involved in recombinant clone formation. DRs are dark green, IRs dark brown. The projection shows the direction of each repeat copy. Slender bar: individual clones; light blue, yellow and orange represent intact, single recombinant and double recombinant clones, respectively. L, C or R affixed to clone numbers: Left, central and right segments of a recombinant clone. Note that L and R segments of a single-recombinant clone have the same repeat copy at the end connecting two segments; head-to-tail for DRs, and head-to-head or tail-to-tail for IRs. The double-recombinant clone has a copy of one repeat pair at one end each of its L and C segments and a copy of another repeat pair at the other end of C and at one end of R that, respectively, connect the L and C segments and the C and R segments by recombination.</p>
