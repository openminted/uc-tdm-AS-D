      <abstract>
        <p>Osmotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold are major environmental factors that limit agricultural productivity worldwide. Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are major signalling events induced by osmotic stress in higher plants. Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase2 family members play essential roles in response to hyperosmotic stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and maize. In this study, the function of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in drought, salt, and freezing stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was characterized. A translational fusion protein of TaSnRK2.4 with green fluorescent protein showed subcellular localization in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. To examine the role of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> under various environmental stresses, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing wheat <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. Overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> resulted in delayed seedling establishment, longer primary roots, and higher yield under normal growing conditions. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> had enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses, which were simultaneously supported by physiological results, including decreased rate of water loss, enhanced higher relative water content, strengthened cell membrane stability, improved photosynthesis potential, and significantly increased osmotic potential. The results show that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> is involved in the regulation of enhanced osmotic potential, growth, and development under both normal and stress conditions, and imply that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> is a multifunctional regulatory factor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Since the overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> can significantly strengthen tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses and does not retard the growth of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants under well-watered conditions, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> could be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stresses in crops.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Drought, salinity, and cold are major environmental stresses that severely reduce agricultural productivity worldwide. To cope with water deficit, plants have developed various mechanisms to protect cellular activities and maintain whole plant integrity. Many stress-induced genes have been identified, including those encoding fundamental enzymes of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray, 1997</xref>), proteins involved in osmotic adaptation and tolerance of cellular dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi, 1997</xref>), cellular protective enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingram and Bartels, 1996</xref>), and a range of signalling proteins such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soderman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) and protein kinases/protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p>
      <p>In eukaryotes, reversible protein phosphorylation is central to perception of and response to environmental stresses, and constitutes a major mechanism for the control of cellular functions, such as responses to environmental stimuli and pathogens, and hormonal control of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Genetic evidence clearly shows that type 2C and 2A protein phosphatases function in the early ABA signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). As a counterpart, various stress-inducible protein kinase families such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wrzaczek and Hirt, 2001</xref>), calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ludwig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK), which were first analysed in yeast from where the name originated, are activated by ABA and diverse stress signals.</p>
      <p>Yeast SNF1 protein kinase, mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and plant SnRK protein are highly conserved and play pivotal roles in growth and metabolic responses to cellular stress. In yeast, SNF1 is involved in a variety of functions, including regulation of glucose-responsive genes, control of pseudohyphal growth under nutrient limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cullen and Sprague, 2000</xref>), and regulation of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honigberg and Lee, 1998</xref>). In mammals, AMPK acts as an energy-level sensor to regulate metabolism under low-energy conditions. In plants, SnRKs were grouped into three subfamilies: SnRK1, SnRK2, and SnRK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hrabak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). SnRK1 kinase is well characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels, and evidence indicates that SnRK1s have roles in regulating energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). SnRK2 and SnRK3 are unique to plants and are involved in responses to environmental stresses. Several SnRK3 members are extensively characterized, and the well-known SOS2 is required for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>Current studies indicate that the SnRK2 family is involved in hyperosmotic stress responses and ABA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Ten SnRK2s were identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; nine of them were activated by hyperosmotic and salinity stresses, and five of the nine were activated by ABA, whereas none was activated by cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). AtSRK2.6/AtSnRK2E/OST1 and <italic>Vicia faba</italic> AAPK were activated by ABA and were involved in ABA regulation of stomatal closing and ABA-regulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>AtSnRK2.8/AtSnRK2C</italic> enhances drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In rice, 10 SnRK2 members were identified; all were activated by hyperosmotic stress, and three were also activated by ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). With overexpression of <italic>SAPK4</italic>, one rice member significantly enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In maize, 10 SnRK2 members were cloned, and most <italic>ZmSnRK2</italic> genes were induced by one or more abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), four SnRK2 members were isolated, and all were activated by hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). NtOSAK, identified in tobacco, was involved in the response to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In wheat, only one SnRK2 member, PKABA1, was induced by ABA and hyperosmotic stress, and it repressed the activities of gibberellic acid-inducible promoters when transiently overexpressed in barley aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez-Cadenas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Previous findings suggest that many SnRK2 members are involved in the response to environmental stimuli, and different members exhibit diverse expression patterns, suggesting they may play different roles in response to abiotic stresses. However, knowledge of specific functions of SnRK2s is fragmentary and their role in stress signalling is still enigmatic. There is a paucity of reports about wheat SnRK2 members.</p>
      <p>In this study, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, an SnRK2 member from wheat, was cloned and its expression patterns in response to water deficit, high salinity, low temperature, and ABA treatment were determined. Various expression patterns occurred with different stresses. Transgenic experiments indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> significantly increased tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Morphological assays revealed that overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> did not cause negative effects on the growth and yield of transgenic plants. Therefore, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> might be utilized to improve abiotic stress tolerance in plants.</p>

        <p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) genotype &#x2018;Hanxuan 10&#x2019; with a conspicuous drought-tolerant phenotype was used in this study. After sterilizing with 75% ethanol and washing with sterilized water, wheat seeds were germinated and cultured with double-distilled water in a growth chamber (20&#xB1;1&#x2009;&#xB0;C, 150&#x2009;&#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 12&#x2009;h light/12&#x2009;h dark cycle). Two-leaf seedlings, which showed extreme tolerance to drought stress at this developmental stage in pilot experiments, were treated with polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000; &#x2013;0.5&#x2009;MPa) solution, 250&#x2009;mM NaCl, low temperature (4&#x2009;&#xB0;C), and 50&#x2009;&#x3BC;M ABA. The treated plants were stressed in the PEG and NaCl solutions, sprayed with ABA, or cultured in low temperature conditions for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72&#x2009;h. Untreated control seedlings continued to be grown in the growth chamber. Whole wheat leaves were sampled from the seedlings at different times, frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x2013;80&#x2009;&#xB0;C for RNA isolation and other analyses.</p>
        <p>To study the expression of target genes at different developmental stages, seedling leaves and roots, the leaf spindle at jointing, and young ears at the heading stage were sampled. Seedlings were grown in the growth chamber as described above, and spindle leaves at jointing and young ears were sampled from plots without environmental stress.</p>

        <title>Construction and screening of a full-length cDNA library database</title>
        <p>Tissues from wheat seedlings at various stages and from mature plants were collected to extract total RNA with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), and mRNA was isolated with oligo d(T) cellulose (Qiagen). Several full-length cDNA libraries of wheat in &#x3BB; Zap II (Stratagene) were constructed with the optimized Cap-trapper method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). A full-length wheat cDNA database was generated with the 3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032; end sequencing data of full-length cDNA clones. To obtain the cDNA sequence of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, the amino acid sequence of rice SAPK4 was used as a query probe to screen the wheat full-length cDNA database. Four candidate clones were obtained by blastp, and the full-length cDNA of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> was identified by sequencing the ends.</p>
        <p>Database searches of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were performed by NCBI/GenBank/Blasting. Sequence alignment and similarity with other species were determined by the megAlign program in DNAStar. The signal sequence was predicted with SignalP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP">http://genome.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP</ext-link>). The functional region and activity sites were identified using PROSITE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/">http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/</ext-link> prosite.html) and SMART motif search programs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://coot.embl-heidelberg.de/SMART">http://coot.embl-heidelberg.de/SMART</ext-link>)</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic tree construction of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic></title>
        <p>Phylogenetic analysis was performed to understand the relationship between TaSnRK2.4 and other SnRK2 members from other plant species. A maximum likelihood tree was constructed with the proml program in the PHYLIP (version 3.68) software package, with the putative amino acid sequences. The bootstrap parameter was set at 100.</p>

        <title>Gene structure analysis</title>
        <p>To analyse the structure of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, a pair of primers flanking the open reading frame (ORF) were designed (forward primer, 5&#x2032;-TGCAGAGTTCCACGATAGGCCG-3&#x2032;, reverse primer, 5&#x2032;-CCTACCGACCCAACGAACGAG-3&#x2032;; LA-Taq (Takara) was utilized to amplify the genome sequence of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, and sequences were analysed with the MegAlign program in DNAStar software.</p>

        <title>Subcellular localization of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> protein</title>
        <p>The full-length cDNA clone of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> was fused upstream of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and put under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in the pJIT163-GFP expression vector for construction of a 35S::<italic>TaSnRK2.4-GFP</italic> fusion protein. Proper restriction sites were added to the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the coding region by PCR; the oligonucleotides for fusion GFP subcloning were: forward primer, 5&#x2032;-GAGA<bold><italic>GTCGAC</italic></bold>ATGGAGAAGTACGAGGCGGT-3&#x2032; (<italic>Sal</italic>I site in bold italics), reverse primer, 5&#x2032;-GAGA<bold><italic>GGATCC</italic></bold>CGAGCTCATGCGGAGCTCT-3&#x2032; (<italic>Bam</italic>HI site in bold italics). The PCR product obtained was digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, and then ligated with the pJIT163-GFP plasmid cut with the corresponding enzyme to create recombinant plasmids for expression of the fusion protein. Positive plasmids were confirmed by restriction analysis, followed by sequencing. The recombinant constructs were transformed into living onion epidermal cells by biolistic bombardment with a GeneGun (Biorad Helios&#x2122;) according to the instruction manual (helium pressure, 150&#x2013;300&#x2009;psi). The subcellular location of TaSnRK2.4 was detected by monitoring the transient expression of GFP in onion epidermal cells. The transformed cells were incubated in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium at 28&#x2009;&#xB0;C for 36&#x2013;48&#x2009;h and then observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leika TCS-NT). The images obtained were recorded automatically. The recombinant constructs and the control pJIT163-GFP plasmid were each bombarded into 20 onion epidermal segments.</p>

        <title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title>
        <p>After treatment with DNase I, the RNA samples were used as templates for cDNA synthesis using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in triplicate with an ABI PRISM<sup>&#xAE;</sup> 7000 system using the SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A <italic>tubulin</italic> transcript was used to quantify the relative transcript level. The qRT-PCR primers were: forward primer, 5&#x2032;-GGTTCATGCAAGCGGAGAGC-3&#x2032;; reverse primer, 5&#x2032;-AACCAAAACCAAACAGAAGCAAAC-3&#x2032;.</p>
        <p>The relative level of gene expression was detected using the 2<sup>&#x2013;&#x394;&#x394;CT</sup> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Livaka and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>). &#x394;&#x394;<italic>C</italic>T=(<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Tubulin</sub>)<sub>Time x</sub>&#x2013;(<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Target</sub>&#x2013;<sub>T,Tubulin</sub>)<sub>Time 0</sub>. The <italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> (cycle threshold) values for both the target and internal control genes were the means of triplicate independent PCRs. Time x is any treated time point (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72&#x2009;h) and Time 0 represents the untreated time (0&#x2009;h). To detect the transcription level of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> at different developmental stages, the expression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in seedling leaves was regarded as standard for its lower level, and the corresponding formula was modified as &#x394;&#x394;<italic>C</italic>T=(<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Tubulin</sub>)<sub>DST</sub>&#x2013;(<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Target</sub>&#x2013;<italic>C</italic><sub>T,Tubulin</sub>)<sub>SL</sub>. DST refers to the developmental stage tissue and SL to the seedling leaf.

The transformation vectors harbouring <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>35S</italic>::<italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> were introduced into <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, and transferred into wild-type (WT) <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Columbia ecotype) plants by floral infiltration. Positive transgenic lines were firstly screened on kanamycin plates and then identified by fluorescence detection and western blotting. The TaSnRK2.4&#x2013;GFP for different transgenic lines was detected with a confocal microscope, and the measurement of protein abundance was relative to the intensity of the GFP signal in 2-d-old seedling roots under the same detection conditions.</p>

        <title>Morphological characterization of transgenic plant roots and shoots</title>
        <p>Transgenic plants were characterized for morphological changes under short-day (12&#x2009;h light/12&#x2009;h dark) photoperiods in a growth chamber with a constant temperature of 22&#x2009;&#xB0;C. Root morphology was examined on MS medium solidified with 1.0% agar.

        <title>Stomatal aperture measurements</title>
        <p>Seedling leaves of the same size were detached; the epidermis was peeled off and immediately placed flat on a glass slide.

        <title>Drought tolerance assays</title>
        <p>Drought tolerance assays were performed on seedlings and mature plants. Both WT and transgenic seeds were germinated on MS medium. Four 7-d-old seedlings were planted in identical pots containing a soil mix (1:1 vermiculite:humus) and well watered. The seedlings were cultured in a greenhouse (22&#x2009;&#xB0;C, 70% humidity, 150&#x2009;&#x3BC;mol m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, 12&#x2009;h light/12&#x2009;h dark cycle) without watering. The difference between the seedling and mature plant treatments was the soil volume in each pot. For the seedling treatment, the soil was half the volume (&#x223C;100&#x2009;ml) of the pot, and for mature plants the soil was three-quarters the volume (&#x223C;150&#x2009;ml).</p>

        <title>Salt tolerance assays</title>
        <p>Salt tolerance assays were conducted at the seedling stage. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings were cultured as described above. Water was withheld for 3 weeks and plants were then well irrigated with NaCl solution (350&#x2009;mM) applied at the bottom of the pots. When the soil was completely saturated with salt water, free NaCl solution was removed and the plants were cultured as normal. To make morphological differences under severe salt stress more distinctive, after 1 week the salt-water-logged pots were placed in 2&#x2009;cm deep fresh water for 24&#x2009;h to leach the salt completely from the soil. Survival rates were recorded 2 weeks later.</p>

        <title>Water loss rate determination</title>
        <p>Water loss rates were measured using 10 plants each of WT and transgenic plants (including GFP transgenic plants). Four-week-old plants were detached from roots and weighed immediately (fresh weight, FW), then the plants were left on the laboratory bench (humidity, 45&#x2013;50%, 20&#x2013;22&#x2009;&#xB0;C) and weighed at the designated time intervals. The proportions of fresh weight loss were calculated relative to the initial plant weights. The plants were finally oven dried for 24&#x2009;h at 80&#x2009;&#xB0;C to a constant dry weight (DW). Relative water contents (RWCs) were measured according to the formula: RWC (%)=(desiccated weight&#x2013;DW)/(FW&#x2013;DW)&#xD7;100.</p>

        <p>Plant cell membrane stability (CMS) was determined with a conductivity meter (DDS-1, YSI), CMS (%)=(1&#x2013;initial electrical conductivity/electrical conductivity after boiling)&#xD7;100. Fifteen 7-d-old seedlings (grown on 1&#xD7; MS medium, 0.8% agar) were transferred to a horizontal screen; seedling roots were completely submerged in PEG-6000 (25.4%, &#x2013;1.4&#x2009;Mpa) or NaCl (250&#x2009;mM). When signs of stress began to appear on WT plants, seedlings were removed and immediately thoroughly rinsed with double-distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) prior to immersion in 20&#x2009;ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O at room temperature. After 2&#x2009;h the initial conductivities of the solutions were recorded. The samples were then boiled for 30&#x2009;min, cooled to room temperature, and the final conductivities were measured.</p>

        <title>Molecular characterization of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic></title>
        <p><italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> (GQ384359) was obtained by screening wheat full-length cDNA libraries. The <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> cDNA is 1335&#x2009;bp in length and consists of 54&#x2009;bp of 5&#x2032;-untranslated region (UTR), 1092&#x2009;bp of ORF, and 173&#x2009;bp of 3&#x2032;-UTR. The ORF encodes a polypeptide of 364 amino acid residues (AARs) with a predicted molecular mass of 42.1&#x2009;kDa and a pI of 6.05. The deduced amino acid sequence shows high homology with counterpart monocot SnRK2 family members, that is <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic>, and relatively lower homology with SnRK2s from dicot species, such as <italic>Glycine max</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. TaSnRK2.4 has 92.5% identity to <italic>O. sativa</italic> SAPK4 (Q5N942), 82.2% to ZmSAPK4 (ACG46236), 80.1% to GmPK3 (AAB68961), and 75.5% to ASK1 (NP_172563) and FsPK (<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>) (CAE54075). Scansite analysis indicated that TaSnRK2.4 has the potential for serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activities and, like other SnRK2s, it has two domains in its N- and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal catalytic domain (4&#x2013;260 AARs) is highly conserved, containing an ATP-binding site (10&#x2013;33 AARs) and a protein kinase-activating site (119&#x2013;131 AARs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The C-terminal region, in which a stretch of acidic amino acids forms a negatively charged domain with the amino acid glutamate, is thought to function in protein&#x2013;protein interactions and is mainly involved in ABA responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The secondary structure prediction revealed that the TaSnRK2.4 sequence formed 11 &#x3B1;-helixes and nine &#x3B2;-pleated sheets. The tertiary structure assay displayed a similar model to the 3D structure of rice SAPK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>

        <p>To characterize further the performance of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants under drought stress in soil, six transgenic lines were selected for drought resistance tests at the seedling and mature growth stages. For the seedling assay, the lower rosette leaves of WT and GFP plants showed slight wilting whereas <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants grew normally after 40&#x2009;d without watering. On the 49th day (just before watering), WT and GFP plants displayed signs of severe wilting (all rosette leaves were severely curled), whereas only some the <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants showed symptoms of severe drought stress. After watering for 1 week, &#x223C;97% of WT and 94% of GFP plants had died, whereas 37&#x2013;70% of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A, B</xref>). For mature plants, after 54&#x2009;d with no water, WT and GFP plants showed severe wilting (most rosettes were curled), whereas only a few <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants had begun to wilt. To determine if the stressed plants could produce seeds, the drought stress treatments were terminated by re-watering. After watering for 1 week, &#x223C;50% of WT and 51% of GFP plants recovered, whereas 68&#x2013;97% of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants survived.

        <title><italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> possesses the typical features of the SnRK2 subfamily</title>
        <p>Hyperosmotic stresses, such as drought, cold, and salinity, severely limit the agricultural yield of wheat. Experimental approaches, including forward and reverse genetics and transcriptome analysis, have been applied to identify key molecular factors that facilitate crop acclimation to environmental stresses. Compelling evidence indicates that protein phosphorylation is one of the central signalling events occurring in response to environmental stress in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ichimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In this study, an osmotic-stress activated protein kinase gene, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, was identified in common wheat, and gene structure analysis indicated similarity to counterparts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), implying <italic>SnRK2.4</italic> evolved before separation of monocots and dicots.</p>
        <p>The expression pattern can be a direct indication of a gene's involvement in developmental or differential events. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtSRK2.8/AtSRK2C was identified as a root-specific protein kinase, and AtSRK2.6/AtSRK2E/OST1 was confirmed to play a pivotal role in stomatal closure in leaves, suggesting that different SnRK2 members have various roles in different tissues. Higher expression levels of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in both the booting spindle and seedling roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) suggested it might act as a fundamental signalling molecule of water and/or nutrient status in soil and play crucial roles in reproductive organ development.</p>
        <p>Growing evidence supports a role for the <italic>SnRK2</italic> family in response to multienvironmental stress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> observed up-regulation of SAPK4 under ABA or NaCl treatment in rice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huai <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> identified the response of <italic>ZmSAPK4/ZmSnRK2.4</italic> to ABA, heat, and NaCl in maize seedlings. In this study, expression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> was detected under diverse environmental stresses, including PEG, salt, cold, and ABA treatments, and similar double-peaked expression patterns were identified under various stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Significant differences in expression levels and response times indicate that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> is very sensitive to NaCl and PEG stresses, and less sensitive to ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> might be involved in the very rapid response to PEG and NaCl stresses.</p>
        <p>Evidence from cultured plant cells shows extremely early activation of AtSRK2C and NtOSAK, suggesting that SnRK2s might be activated almost from the beginning of osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). An original aim of the present study was to detect dynamic responses of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>. Transcriptional peaks were witnessed as early as 1&#x2009;h after stress was applied, a result that was quite similar to that found for AtSRK2C reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>. In future research, additional time points and shorter time periods need be set for more precise identification of response activation of TaSnRK2.4s following osmotic stress.</p>

        <title><italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> overexpression has no adverse effects in Arabidopsis</title>
        <p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of TaSnRK2.4 in plant abiotic resistance, the fused TaSnRK2.4&#x2013;GFP was overexpressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Before functional analysis of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> was re-identified by western blotting (data not shown). Growth retardation is a common phenomenon, often occurring in transgenic plants and severely restricting the utilization of target genes in plant breeding. To assess the feasibility of using <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in transgenic breeding for abiotic stress tolerance, the morphological features of transgenic <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants were closely monitored. Seed germination of transgenic plants was delayed by 24&#x2009;h relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">data not shown</xref>). Seed dormancy is a complex trait, influenced by a myriad of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are mediated by hormones, with gibberellin, ethylene, and brassinosteroids known to promote germination and ABA known to promote dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koornneef <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recent studies show that AtSnRK2D/AtSnRK2.2, AtSnRK2E/AtSnRK2.6, and AtSnRK2I/AtSnRK2.3 protein kinases involved in ABA signalling are essential for the control of seed development and dormancy through extensive control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujii <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The extended SET of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> seed may possibly be due to dormancy. The existing reports and results of this study support the classification of AtSnRK2D/AtSnRK2.2, AtSnRK2E/AtSnRK2.6, and AtSnRK2I/AtSnRK2.3 protein kinases in subclass III and TaSnRK2.4 in subclass I of the SnRK2 family. All are involved in seed dormancy, suggesting that participation in dormancy is a basic function of this kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Pre-harvest sprouting, which commonly occurs in conditions of prolonged rainfall and high humidity before harvesting, severely affects the yield and quality of wheat. The extended SET of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> seed can be regarded as a form of sprouting delay that might be usable to improve pre-harvest sprouting resistance in wheat. Although the current data provide no obvious explanation for the delayed germination, more focus should be given to determining the cause of prolonged SET. This will not only provide an understanding of the delayed germination, but overexpression of TaSnRK2.4 may have a role in pre-harvest sprouting control in wheat.</p>
        <p>The visibly smaller seedling size of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants is probably due to the prolonged SET, a difference that vanished later in development. Root length determination results indicate that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants have longer primary roots than the WT and GFP control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp331/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). A longer root would most probably facilitate water absorption from deeper soils especially when water shortages occur, thus strengthening drought tolerance and increasing biomass and yield. In this study, the silique sizes and yield per plant of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> transformants were much larger than those of the WT contols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B, C</xref>), further suggesting that use of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> might be feasible in enhancing yield. Stomatal dynamics are key in reducing water loss and allowing entry of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Compelling evidence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicates that AtSnRK2.6/AtSnRK2E/OST1 can integrate ABA signals and osmotic stress, and is involved in ABA-dependent stomatal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).The width, length, area, and density of stomata, as well as the area ratio of stomata to leaf were measured, and no obvious differences were identified (data not shown), showing that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> does not participate in the regulation of stomatal development and aperture.</p>

        <title>Physiological changes in transgenic TaSnRK2.4 plants under various conditions</title>
        <p>Environmental stresses often cause physiological changes in plants. Physiological indices, including CMS, OP, RWC, and chlorophyll fluorescence, are typical physiological parameters for evaluating abiotic stress tolerance and resistance in crop plants. In general, plants with higher CMS, RWC, OP, and photosynthetic capacities have enhanced tolerance or resistance to environmental stresses.</p>
        <p>RWC and detached-leaf water loss rate are essential parameters of water status in plants and have been proposed as important indicators of water status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhanda and Sethi, 1998</xref>). RWC is closely related to cell volume and may more closely reflect the balance between water supply to leaves and transpiration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farquhar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). In the present work, the detached-leaf water loss rate of <italic>TaSnRK2.4 Arabidopsis</italic> was lower than that of the WT and GFP controls, and the final RWCs for <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> seedlings were significantly higher than those of the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), strongly indicating that the transgenic lines had higher water retention ability.</p>
        <p>Plant survival depends on maintaining positive turgor pressure, which is important for cell expansion and stomatal opening. A decrease in water availability induced by osmotic stress might lead to turgor reduction. Osmotic adjustment (OA) is a fundamental cell tolerance response to osmotic stress, and can be realized by the accumulation of diverse osmoprotectants. Generally, a higher capacity for OA means broader adaptation and more tolerance to osmotic stress. OP is a direct reflection of OA capability at the physiological level, and has been used as an effective index to screen crop germplasm for osmotic stress tolerance. Our research indicates the OP of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> lines is significantly higher than that of WT and GFP controls under well-watered conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results strongly indicated that the increased OP in transgenic plants is due to the overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, rather than GFP. Increased OP is primarily attributed to accumulation of osmoprotectants, including amino acids, quaternary amines, and various sugars. It is well documented that proline is the most widely distributed multifunctional osmolyte, occurring not only in plants, but also in many other organisms, and playing important roles in enhancing osmotic stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartels and Sunkar, 2005</xref>). An increase in free proline was not detected in <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants, suggesting that proline was not the main reason for OP augmentation, and that TaSnRK2.4 was not likely to be involved in the pathway of proline metabolism. Higher OP commonly predicts higher water retention capacity and a lower rate of water loss, as well as higher water use efficiency. The results of OP analysis were consistent with the above-mentioned detached-leaf water loss rate and RWC results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), and partially explain the enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stresses.</p>
        <p>Cell membranes are one of the first targets of many plant stresses. It is generally accepted that the maintenance of membrane integrity and stability under water stress conditions is a major component of environmental stress tolerance in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levitt, 1980</xref>). CMS has been used for assessing tolerance to frost, heat, and desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farooq and Azam, 2006</xref>). In most of these studies, CMS exhibits a positive correlation with several physiological and biochemical parameters conditioning plant responses to environmental conditions such as water use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), stomatal resistance, OP, leaf rolling index, K<sup>+</sup> concentration, OA, and/or RWC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munns, 2002</xref>). The degree of CMS under environmental stresses can be easily estimated through measurements of electrolyte leakage from cells. In this study, the CMS of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants under both osmotic and salinity stresses was higher than that of the WT and GFP controls, clearly demonstrating that CMS enhancement is caused by overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>. As mentioned above, CMS has a positive relationship with several physiological and biochemical parameters; it predicts that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants might have a strong capacity to tolerate environmental stresses, as verified by the functional assay results in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs 8</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"/>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>).</p>
        <p>Chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves, especially fluorescence induction patterns, is a reliable, non-invasive method for monitoring photosynthetic events and reflects the physiological status of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strasser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence is an important parameter used to assess the physiological status of the photosynthetic apparatus. It represents the maximum quantum yield of the primary photochemical reaction of PSII. Environmental stresses that affect PSII efficiency are known to provoke decreases in the <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krause and Weis, 1991</xref>). In this research, the slightly darker leaf colour and lower <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio were evident in WT and GFP plants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp331/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S4</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), undoubtedly suggesting that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants had more robust photosynthetic capabilities than the controls under moderate drought stress conditions.</p>

Several research groups have demonstrated that OST1/SnRK2E/SRK2.6 and <italic>V. faba</italic> AAPK are involved in ABA-dependent stomatal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> showed that overexpression of AtSnRK2C/AtSnRK2.8 increases the expression of stress-related genes and thus enhances drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>SAPK4</italic> significantly enhanced the salt tolerance of transgenic rice through regulating genes with functions in ion homeostasis and the oxidative stress response. In terms of actual mechanisms, it remains unknown as to how SAPK4 prevents Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup> from entering the cell and how the cell maintains ion homeostasis. In the present research, transgenic <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants were exposed to severe drought, salt, and freeze stresses. The morphological and physiological evidence strongly demonstrated that the transgenic lines acquired strengthened tolerance to severe drought, high salinity, and freezing stresses relative to WT plants. Our understanding is that enhanced multistress tolerance is possibly due to increased osmotic potential. Under water-deficient conditions, enhancement of OP leads to reduced water loss and increased RWC in plant cells, possibly facilitating the enhanced water retention ability, benefiting the maintenance of regular cell turgor, and avoiding damage to cell membranes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. Under salt stress, the higher OP probably prevents entry of harmful ions, including Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x2013;</sup>, thus relieving ion damage to cell membranes, and therefore increasing salt tolerance. Under cold stress, higher OP commonly means more solutes in the plant sap, resulting in lower freezing points and hence reduced freezing damage. In the current work, gene expression levels and protein abundance for the two transgenic lines (L4 and L5) were relatively lower than for the other four transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp331/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), whereas their capability of osmotic tolerance was much stronger than that of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"/>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This seems to suggest that the overexpression level is not directly proportional to the ability for abiotic stress resistance, which hints that an appropriate overexpression level should be considered when generating transgenic plants with a regulatory gene controlled by a constitutive overexpressing promoter for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance.</p>
        <p>This study primarily concerned the morphological and physiological features of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under normal and adverse conditions. Further comprehensive investigations to dissect the actual molecular mechanisms for enhancing OP are ongoing and it is believed that the outcomes may enable tolerance to abiotic stresses levels in crop plats to be strengthened.</p>
