      <abstract>
        <p>We report here the sequencing and analysis of the genome of the nitrogen-fixing endophyte, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 342. Although <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 342 is a member of the enteric bacteria, it serves as a model for studies of endophytic, plant-bacterial associations due to its efficient colonization of plant tissues (including maize and wheat, two of the most important crops in the world), while maintaining a mutualistic relationship that encompasses supplying organic nitrogen to the host plant. Genomic analysis examined <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 342 for the presence of previously identified genes from other bacteria involved in colonization of, or growth in, plants. From this set, approximately one-third were identified in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 342, suggesting additional factors most likely contribute to its endophytic lifestyle. Comparative genome analyses were used to provide new insights into this question. Results included the identification of metabolic pathways and other features devoted to processing plant-derived cellulosic and aromatic compounds, and a robust complement of transport genes (15.4%), one of the highest percentages in bacterial genomes sequenced. Although virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were predicted, experiments conducted using mouse models showed pathogenicity to be attenuated in this strain. Comparative genomic analyses with the presumed human pathogen <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> MGH78578 revealed that MGH78578 apparently cannot fix nitrogen, and the distribution of genes essential to surface attachment, secretion, transport, and regulation and signaling varied between each genome, which may indicate critical divergences between the strains that influence their preferred host ranges and lifestyles (endophytic plant associations for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 342 and presumably human pathogenesis for MGH78578). Little genome information is available concerning endophytic bacteria. The <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 342 genome will drive new research into this less-understood, but important category of bacterial-plant host relationships, which could ultimately enhance growth and nutrition of important agricultural crops and development of plant-derived products and biofuels.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Bacterial endophytes are capable of inhabiting the living tissues of plants without causing them significant harm. <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 342 (Kp342) is a model for this plant host-bacterial association, in part due to its capacity to colonize in high numbers the interior of plants including wheat and maize, two of the most important crops in the world. Kp342 possesses the ability to capture atmospheric nitrogen gas and turn it into an organic form (a process known as nitrogen fixation), of which part may be used as fertilizer by its plant host. Here, we describe the genome sequence and analysis of this model endophyte. When the Kp342 genome is compared to the genome of a closely related pathogenic relative, we can begin to surmise that its preference to engage in a harmonious relationship with plants is a result of many interacting factors. These include differences in its protein secretion systems, the manner in which its genes are regulated, and its ability to sense and respond to its environment. The study of endophytes is increasing in intensity due to the roles they may play in multiple biotechnological applications, including enhancing crop growth and nutrition, bioremediation, and development of plant-derived products and biofuels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 342 (hereafter Kp342) is a mutualistic, diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) endophyte and as such is capable of providing small but critical amounts of fixed nitrogen in the form of ammonia by the colonization of the interior of their plant hosts while receiving vital nutrients and protection without inducing symbiotic structures or causing disease symptoms. This form of plant-bacterial association contrasts with other, better studied bacterial interactions with plants in which bacteria can cause disease (pathogens), form obligate associations beneficial to the bacterium which may or may not benefit the plant (symbionts) or colonize the surface of plant structures (epiphytes) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Danhorn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The genus, <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, named after the microbiologist Edwin Klebs, are characterized as rod-shaped, Gram-negative &#x3B3;-proteobacteria that can live in water, soil, and plants and are pathogenic to humans and animals <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Podschun1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In plants, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strains capable of living as endophytes are of interest as they can increase plant growth under agricultural conditions <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Riggs1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and provide fixed nitrogen to certain grasses <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Sevilla1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Iniguez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Culture independent analyses have also suggested the presence of <italic>Klebsiella</italic> in sweet potato <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Reiter1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and strains have been isolated from the interior of rice <xref rid="pgen.1000141-An1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, maize <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Chelius1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, sugarcane <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ando1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and banana <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. <italic>Klebsiella</italic> strains may also be human pathogens contaminating the food supply. In humans, certain strains of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> are known to cause nosocomial urinary tract infections, and pneumonia, leading to septicemia and death.</p>
      <p>Enteric bacteria are frequent inhabitants of the plant interior and can induce plant defenses, thereby reducing their numbers in plants. In particular, strains of <italic>Klebsiella</italic> are routinely found within a variety of host plants <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Martinez1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Rosenblueth1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Flagella are known to induce plant defense <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Felix1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Zipfel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. As <italic>Klebsiella</italic> lack flagella, their high numbers in plants may be attributed at least in part to their lack of extracellular structures that induce plant defenses <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Iniguez2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Kp342 was isolated from the interior of nitrogen-efficient maize plants <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Chelius2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> as part of a search for nitrogen-fixing endophytes in maize that may be used in the future to reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizers required for optimum yield. Later work showed that this strain could provide a small amount of fixed nitrogen to wheat under greenhouse conditions <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Iniguez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In addition, this strain was found to colonize the interior of a wide variety of host plants with a very small inoculum dose <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Dong2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Kp342 also colonizes the interior of alfalfa sprout seedlings in much higher numbers than other enteric bacteria tested <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Dong3" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Plants express two types of defense systems in response to microorganisms in the environment. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is induced by plant pathogens and can be stimulated in plants by addition of salicylic acid. Induced systemic resistance (ISR) is induced by bacteria in the rhizosphere and is regulated within the plant by levels of the plant hormones, jasmonic acid and ethylene. Kp342 induces ISR but not SAR while other enteric bacteria induce both systems <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Iniguez2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Though the molecular basis for nitrogen fixation in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> has been well characterized <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Arnold1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, little is known about how plant-associated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates promote plant growth without eliciting plant defense mechanisms. Likewise, the potential for endophytic <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates to cause human disease is also poorly understood and the potential of plant-associated <italic>Klebsiella</italic> strains to act as reservoirs for drug resistance genes is also unknown.</p>
      <p>This study presents the whole genome sequence of Kp342 as well as comparative genomic analyses to other sequenced enteric genomes. The Kp342 genome revealed genes for multiple drug resistances as well as genes for virulence to animals, which further motivated experimental verification of antibiotic resistances and infection in mice. The genomic analyses in this study also include a comparison to a closely related clinical strain isolated from sputum <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ogawa1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> MGH78578 (hereafter MGH78578). In one previous study, MGH78578 was determined to have a limited ability to colonize the interior of wheat roots in comparison to Kp342 <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>; however, its ability to interact with other plants or form other types of plant associations is at present unknown.</p>
      <p>The whole genome analyses presented here were completed in order to identify new insights into genetic characteristics that may be influential to the ability of Kp342 to adopt an efficient endophytic lifestyle. Further, these analyses revealed new insights into antibiotic resistance mechanisms, metabolism, surface attachments, secretion systems, and insertion element and transporter content.</p>

        <p>The genome of Kp342 is composed of a single circular chromosome of 5,641,239 bp with an overall G+C content of 57.29% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000141-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and two plasmids: pKP187, 187,922 bp, 47.15% G+C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000141-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); and pKP91, 91,096 bp, 51.09% G+C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000141-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). There are eight sets of 5S, 16S and 23S rRNA genes and three structural RNA genes which include 1 tmRNA, 1 SRP/4.5S RNA, and 1 RNAaseP RNA. A total of 88 tRNA genes with specificities for all 20 amino acids and a single tRNA for selenocysteine were identified. The chromosome encodes 5425 putative <underline>c</underline>o<underline>d</underline>ing <underline>s</underline>equences (CDS) representing 88.2% coding density and plasmids pKP91 and pKP187 each encode 113 and 230 putative CDSs having 84.8% and 80.1% coding density, respectively. The preliminary analysis of the genome suggests that of the 5768 total CDSs, 3963 (68.7%) can be assigned biological role categories, while 581 (10.1%) have been annotated as enzymes of unknown function. Conserved hypothetical proteins are represented by 693 (12.0%) CDSs and 531 (9.2%) are hypothetical proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t001">Table 1</xref>). The average chromosomal gene length is found to be 912 nucleotides, while the average gene length for pKP91 and pKP187 are 638 and 607 nucleotides, respectively. The start codon ATG is preferred (87.9% of the time), while GTG and TTG are used 8.7% and 3.4% of the time, respectively.</p>

            <title>Circular Representation of the Closed Genome of Kp342.</title>
            <p>The chromosome (A) is illustrated as a circle where each concentric circle represents genomic data and is numbered from the outermost to the innermost circle. Refer to the key for details on color representations and circle number. The comparisons to <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (circle 5) and MGH78578 (circle 4) are noted as follows. The color indicates the position of the matching Kp342 region (circle 2) using NUCMER. The height of the tick indicates the percent identity of the NUCMER match. Plasmids pKP187 (B) and pKP91 (C) are likewise depicted circular, but each concentric circle from 4 to the innermost circle shows the NUCMER match to previously sequenced plasmids from NCBI, colored by the percent identity of the matching region. See key for color conversion.</p>

        <p>The larger of the two plasmids, pKP187, is most similar to the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> CG43 virulence plasmid pLVPK <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> at the nucleotide level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000141-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Use of the genome alignment program, NUCMER <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Delcher1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, revealed that the similarity is mainly limited to regions of the plasmid encoding replication, partitioning/maintenance, arsenate and tellurite resistance, and transposase/recombinase functions. Unlike pLVPK, which has only one, pKP187 encodes two replication genes, which are 46% identical at the protein level and both are recognized by PF01051, Initiator Replication protein. The first <italic>rep</italic> gene (KPK_A0248) was chosen as the origin of replication because it is flanked by iteron repeat sequences. The second <italic>rep</italic> gene, KPK_A0025, did not have detectable flanking iteron repeat structures, but was most similar to <italic>repA</italic> of pLVPK. Another notable difference between pLVPK and pKP187 is the absence from pKP187 of the virulence-associated iron-acquisition siderophore systems and CPS biosynthesis control loci <italic>rmpA</italic> and <italic>rmpA2</italic>. This plasmid (pKP187) also encodes a putative innate immunity cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance protein, PagP (formerly CrcA) (KPK_A0097) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The smaller plasmid, pKP91 also has two <italic>rep</italic> genes, <italic>repA</italic> (KPK_B0121) and <italic>repE</italic> (KPK_B0094) and has the most overall nucleotide similarity to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> plasmids pK245, pKPN3, and pKPN4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000141-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This similarity is restricted to regions of the plasmids conferring replication, partitioning, conjugal transfer, and transposon functions. The origin of replication was chosen downstream of <italic>repA</italic>, which has 95% protein identity to <italic>repA</italic> of the IncFII <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> plasmid pGSH500, so that nucleotide one of the DnaA box (TTATTCACA) is the beginning of the plasmid sequence <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Osborn1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This plasmid also encodes a plasmid addiction module (KPK_B0088 and KPK_B0087), as well as several oxidoreductase genes, and a putative fusaric acid resistance gene.</p>
        <p>Full-length transposase genes were manually annotated with the assistance of the ISFinder database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-is.biotoul.fr/">http://www-is.biotoul.fr/</ext-link>). Twenty full-length and 17 fragmented insertion sequence (IS) elements, belonging to six transposase families were identified in the Kp342 chromosome and two plasmids. These IS elements encoded four different IS3 transposases, one IS5 transposase, one IS6 transposase, three different IS110 transposases, one IS481 transposase, and one ISL3 transposase. Most of the IS elements are segregated to either the chromosome or one of the plasmids. However, the seven copies of the IS5 family element, which are 99% identical at the protein level to IS903B in the database, have been identified in all three DNA molecules with five copies in the chromosome and one copy in each of the plasmids. Therefore, it is likely that the chromosome and two plasmids have been in close association long enough for dissemination of IS903B from one DNA molecule to the other two. Also, measuring the number of full-length IS elements in each kb of the three DNA molecules reveals approximately 20- to 60-fold higher density of insertions in the plasmids compared to the chromosome with seven copies in the &#x223C;5641 kb chromosome, five copies in &#x223C;187 kb of pKP187, and seven copies in &#x223C;91 kb of pKP91.</p>
        <p>The genome was examined for the presence or absence of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) using CRISPRFinder <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Grissa1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

        <title>Overview of Metabolism in Kp342</title>
        <p>Analyses of the Kp342 genome reflected its most distinguishing features as a diazotroph, facultative anaerobe and an endophyte. Genome analyses confirmed each of these abilities while also revealing fundamentally new insights into the metabolic potential of this organism. Of particular importance was the presence of a large complement of genes devoted to carbohydrate, including cellulosic and aromatic compound degradation, many of plant origin. These traits are likely to make Kp342 important to carbon and nutrient cycling and its ability to form endophytic associations. However, this gene complement may also prove useful for further exploration in biotechnological applications including conversion of cellulose to biofuels and the bioremediation of aromatic compounds. For a general synopsis of central intermediary and energy metabolism, including sulfur and phosphorous metabolism, and electron transport, refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s017">Text S1</xref>. Highlights of the nitrogen cycle, sugar, cellulosic and aromatic metabolism in Kp342 are described below.</p>

        <title>The Nitrogen Cycle</title>
        <p>Among the fundamental roles that Kp342 plays in the nitrogen cycle is its capacity to fix nitrogen <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Iniguez1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Chelius2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which was confirmed through genome analyses by the presence of a nitrogen fixation regulon (KPK_1696-KPK_1715) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000141-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, comparative genomic analyses determined that genes associated with nitrogen fixation including nitrogenase, the enzyme central to this process, are absent in MGH78578. It is therefore presumed that MGH78578 cannot fix nitrogen. Central reactions of the nitrogen cycle which Kp342 can perform based on genome analyses are the uptake of nitrate using an assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductase, respectively (KPK_2087-KPK_2086) and use of nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen.</p>
        <p>Of further importance to its role in the nitrogen cycle is the ability of Kp342 to degrade urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide via both the urease complex (which is present in MGH78578) and the two-step reaction catalyzed by urea amidolyase <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Kanamori1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> (KPK_2626-KPK_2627) which is absent from MGH78578. The ability to serve additional roles within the nitrogen cycle was also revealed. For example, the presence of a nitrile hydratase (KPK_2673-KPK_2672) which catabolizes various nitrile compounds to their corresponding amides is a feature not noted in other enteric genomes sequenced to date including MGH78578.</p>

          <title>Cellulosic Metabolism</title>
          <p>Cellulose is the most abundant carbohydrate in the biosphere followed by starch of which both are widely produced by plants <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Doi1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The association of Kp342 with plants is greatly suggested by the wide variety of genes devoted to the transport and metabolism of these compounds. Of particular importance was the elucidation of a gene complement capable of hydrolyzing &#x3B1;-linked glucans of starches and pectins and another capable of splitting 1,4-&#x3B2;-glucosidic bonds of cellulosic components and long chain polymers of beta-glucose such as chitin. At least 38 genes were placed into 16 glycosyl hydrolase families that could be assigned functions belonging to O-glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1-) responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between two or more carbohydrates, or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate compound <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Rabinovich1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Of these, 35 were found on the main chromosome and three on the plasmid, pKP187.</p>
          <p>At least two genes can be confidently assigned functions (and EC numbers) related to the decomposition of highly ordered forms of insoluble cellulose <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Hilden1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, KPK_A0121, cellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase (<italic>celK</italic>) (EC#3.2.1.91), an exoglucanase and KPK_0224, cellulase (<italic>bcsZ</italic>), (EC#3.2.1.4), an endogluconase. Additional genes encoding enzymes with specificity towards 1,4-&#x3B2;-glucosidic bonds and most likely act by hydrolyzing short cello-oligosaccharides include: KPK_2587, beta-glucosidase (<italic>bglH</italic>), (EC#3.2.1.21), a cytoplasmic beta-glucosidase, and KPK_1599, beta-glucosidase (<italic>bglX</italic>), (EC#3.2.1.21), its periplasmic form.</p>

          <title>Cellulosic Metabolism&#x2013;Plasmid Associations</title>
          <p>Of the three glycosyl hydrolase genes found on pKP187, two were co-localized, the aforementioned KPK_A0121 and a putative glucan 1,4-beta-glucosidase (<italic>celD</italic>) (KPK_A0120), whose probable function is involved in sequentially cleaving 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages from the non-reducing end of crystalline cellulose or cello-oligosaccharides. An additional member of the glycosyl hydrolase 1 family was also found (KPK_A0131). As a probable cellobiase the gene product is also likely responsible for the hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing beta-D-glucose residues with release of beta-D-glucose.</p>
          <p>Phylogenetic analyses of the predicted protein sequences of the <italic>celD</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) and <italic>cel</italic>K (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) homologs revealed that they are more closely related to non-enteric bacteria. For example, the closest relatives to the <italic>celD</italic> homolog are <italic>Vibrio shiloni</italic> and <italic>Photobacterium</italic> sp. SKA34, which are marine dwelling &#x3B3;-proteobacteria. In the case of the <italic>celK</italic> homolog, the closest relatives are to the low G+C firmicutes including members of the genus, <italic>Clostridium</italic>. The determination of these genes on a plasmid along with the results of the phylogenetic analyses including the lack of homologs in MGH78578 suggests that their presence in the Kp342 genome could be the result of a lateral transfer event although other mechanisms such as gene loss, or even sampling bias could be responsible for the incongruent results of the phylogenetic gene trees when compared to 16S rRNA-based trees.</p>

          <title>Conversion of Hemicellulosic Substrates to Sugars</title>
          <p>Genome analyses also revealed an ability to convert various hemicellulosic substrates to fermentable sugars. For example, the Kp342 genome possesses the ability to metabolize common components of xylan, arabinose and xylose. Genes related to this metabolism include duplications of <italic>xylA</italic> (xylose isomerase) (KPK_0176, KPK_4922) and <italic>xylB</italic> (xylulokinase) (KPK_0177, KPK_1623) responsible for creating the phosphorylated derivative, D-xylulose 5-phosphate.

Arabinofuranosidases work synergistically with xylanases to degrade xylan to its component sugars.</p>
          <p>In addition to synthesis of glycogen, the Kp342 genome also encodes genes capable of degrading the &#x3B1;-linked glucans (primarily 1,4-&#x3B1; and 1,6 &#x3B1;-linkages) of glycogen, plant starches and pectins as well as the degradation of low molecular weight carbohydrates produced from their breakdown such as maltodextrins, pullulan and D-galacturonate. Genome analyses also revealed the ability to metabolize a wide variety of five and six carbon sugars including, fructose, fucose, rhamnose, arabinose, galactose and glucose and sugar alcohols such as mannitol (to fructose) and sorbitol (to fructose).</p>

        <p>Genome analyses identified the potential of Kp342 to oxidatively catabolize a variety of low-molecular mass aromatic compounds, many of which arise from lignin degradation, including ferrulic acid, vanillate (KPK_2715, KPK_2713, KPK_2433 KPK_2298) and 2-chlorobenzoate (KPK_2486-KPK_2484) to the central aromatic ring metabolites, protochatechuate and catechol <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Priefert1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Eulberg1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Genome analyses further elucidated the presence of a protocatechuate pathway in which ring cleavage is subsequently mediated by the 3,4-protocatechuate dioxygenase (KPK_2400-KPK_2401), and the ortho cleavage pathway of catechol, in which ring cleavage is mediated by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (KPK_2483) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Priefert1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Eulberg1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

        <p>Genome analyses also revealed that the Kp342 genome may also be capable of reductive, non-oxidative decarboxylations of some aromatic compounds.

        <title>Small Molecule Transport</title>
        <p>Kp342 possesses an exceptionally robust transporter repertoire, encoding 888 transporter genes (15.4%), one of the highest percentages of CDSs functioning as transporters identified to date (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s004">Table S1</xref>). The total number of transporters is similar to plant/soil-associated microbes, such as <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic> (986, 11.9%), <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> (885, 12.2%) and <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (835, 15.5%) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ren2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The distribution of transporter families is similar to the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>; however, Kp342 exhibits an expansion in the majority of transporter families analyzed. For example, the genome encodes 422 (7.3%) ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family transporter genes and 128 (2.2%) Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) genes (the highest number of MFS genes in all sequenced prokaryotic genomes) while <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 encodes 210 (5.0%) and 70 (1.7%) genes respectively. Transporters in these families are involved in the uptake of various nutrients, such as sugars, amino acids, peptides, nucleosides and various ions, as well as the extrusion of metabolite waste, toxic byproducts and antibiotics.</p>
        <p>There are also several families of transporters present in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> but absent in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including the <italic>citW</italic> (KPK_4687), <italic>citS</italic> (KPK_4716) and <italic>citX</italic> (KPK_4686) homologs of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter (2-HCT) family.

In contrast, <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 encodes a single protein, CitT, a Divalent Anion:Sodium Symporter (DASS) family transporter, for the uptake of citrate.

When compared to Kp342, the clinical strain MGH78578 encodes slightly fewer transporter genes, 836 transporter genes (16.1% of CDSs).

        <title>Site-Specific Integrated Elements and Bacteriophages</title>
        <p>A total of thirteen site-specific integrated elements have been identified in the genome of Kp342, including two putatively integrated plasmids and two prophages. The data compiled for these integrated elements is presented in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s005">Table S2</xref>). Twelve of the thirteen site-specific recombinases were from the tyrosine recombinase family and targeted either tRNAs or inserted in tandem into tRNA-derived sequences (8), genes (3) or intergenic regions (1). Where possible, putative element boundaries were determined by locating flanking direct repeats, indicative of the core attachment sequence. Many of these repeat-flanked regions were confirmed by other data such as insertion within an operon or by atypical G+C%.</p>
        <p>IE01 appears to be a phage-like bacteriocin, analogous to <italic>Pseudomonas pyocins</italic>, which encodes phage tail fibers and lytic enzymes, with a nested insertion into the 5&#x2032; end of <italic>umuC</italic> by another element IE01b. IE02 encodes a beta-ketoadipyl CoA thiolase (KPK_1840), an MFS-family transporter (KPK_1839), and a polyketide synthase (KPK_1838) that may be used by Kp342 to convert plant-derived aromatic compounds to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA and subsequently into a polyketide, which may be expelled from the cell by a CDS having high sequence similarity to a methylenomycin A resistance efflux pump (KPK_1835). It is interesting that KPK_1841- KPK_1838 protein sequences have high identity and synteny to <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> ATCC 12472 genes CV4290-CV4293 and KPK_1836- KPK_1835 with CV0720-CV0719, suggesting that these genes may exist as mobile functional units. IE03 encodes three proteins, which may be involved in the synthesis of putrescine and metabolism of polyamines. IE04 encodes a type IV secretion system (KPK_1774- KPK_1789). These protein sequences have best BLASTP matches to the <italic>Erwinia caratovora</italic> subsp. <italic>atroseptica</italic> plasmid-like integrated element HAI7 (ECA1612-ECA1627) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Though this secretion system may very well be involved in conjugal transfer of DNA, it may also have a dual role in the secretion of virulence determinants, as was shown in <italic>E. caratovora</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Analyses of IE05, IE07 and IE10 revealed the presence of tyrosine recombinases, while all other CDSs identified encode only proteins with unknown function. IE06 encodes a type I restriction-modification system as well as two acetyltransferase genes, a putative glyoxalase, and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It is unclear if any of these enzymes would have a selective advantage; however, this integrated element encodes a protein (KPK_4954) with similarity (37.8% identity and 57% similarity over 2782 aa) to NdvB of <italic>Rhizobium meliloti</italic>, a protein required for the synthesis of cyclic Beta-(1,2)-glucan, nodule invasion and bacteroid development <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ielpi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, possibly having a role in osmotic adaptation <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. IE08 and IE09 appear to be integrated plasmids, encoding genes with similarity to plasmid replication genes, partitioning genes and mobilization genes, but carry no genes with identifiable function. Similar to IE11, IE01, encodes proteins homologous to UmuC and UmuD; however, unlike IE01, IE11 also encodes RecE and RecT DNA repair enzymes.</p>
        <p>In addition to the 11 site-specific integrated elements described above, the genome of Kp342 also harbors 2 prophage genomes. Both prophage regions were predicted by Phage_Finder <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Fouts1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. PHAGE01 is predicted to be 36346 bp in size, with a G+C% of 47.4%, and appears to have inserted into KPK_3407 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) at nucleotide positions 3425830-3389485 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s005">Table S2</xref>). PHAGE02 is slightly larger (48557 bp) with a slightly higher G+C content of 52.8%. It is inserted into a tRNA-Arg at nucleotide coordinates 4230390-4181834. Both regions and all integrated elements had G+C% compositions less than the whole Kp342 chromosome (57.3% G+C). PHAGE01 has 7 out of 22 possible best matches (using Phage_Finder) to <italic>Klebsiella</italic> phage while PHAGE02 has 7 out of 44 possible best matches to <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> phage OP2.</p>

          <p>From this study several important differences between the Kp342 and MGH78578 genomes are evident which may have important implications concerning their preferred lifestyle and host range (endophyte for Kp342 and human pathogen presumably for MGH78578). A clear difference is present in transcription factor content and signaling proteins which may contribute to dissimilarities in the regulatory networks of these two organisms. The Kp342 genome possesses forty-eight transcription factors classified in at least nine families of transcriptional regulators of diverse function and five additional CDSs annotated as putative transcription factors not found in MGH78578 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s008">Table S5</xref>). Conversely, six transcription factors from three transcription factor families (LysR, DeoR, IclR) were identified in MGH78578 but not Kp342 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s009">Table S6</xref>). In addition, at least two anti-anti-sigma factors (KPK_3076 and KPK_3564) are present in Kp342 which are not found in MGH78578 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s008">Table S5</xref>). Anti-anti-sigma factors play critical roles in regulating the expression of alternative sigma factors in response to specific stress signals <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The anti-anti-sigma factors identified here each posses a Sulfate Transporter and AntiSigma factor antagonist (STAS) domain and are paralogs of one another. Therefore, they are presumably related by gene duplication, but they may have different physiological functions that remain to be determined in Kp342.</p>
          <p>At least 13 genes whose functions are related to signal transduction in Kp342 were not identified in MGH78578 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s008">Table S5</xref>). These include members of two-component systems (KPK_2666, KPK_3077, KPK_3085), the phosphotransferase system important to active transport and regulation of carbohydrate uptake, and regulators of the global secondary messenger protein cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP), specifically diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases (KPK_2890, KPK_3355, KPK_3356, KPK_3392, KPK_3558, KPK_3794).</p>
          <p>Bacterial surface-associated structures such as fimbriae have been determined to play a role in bacterial adhesion to host cells including plants and animals and in biofilm formation <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Danhorn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Weening1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Several differences in fimbrial content were noted between the two strains. The Kp342 genome contains three fimbrial proteins (KPK_0824, KPK_2632 and KPK_2633) not present in MGH78578 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s008">Table S5</xref>). Conversely MGH78578 possesses at least 13 CDSs annotated as structural proteins, or members of a chaperon/usher system not found in Kp342 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s009">Table S6</xref>). This set includes homologs to the <italic>stb</italic> fimbrial operon of the human pathogen <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Typhimurium, which was reported to be critical to persistence of this organism in the gut of mice <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Weening1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Differences in the distribution of genes devoted to Type IV and Type VI secretion systems were noted in this study between Kp342 and MGH78578. The Type IV secretion system identified on integrated element IE04 in Kp342 is absent in MGH78578 as well as an additional Type IV pilus assembly family protein (KPK_0839) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s008">Table S5</xref>).

However, at least four CDSs determined in Kp342 putatively involved in TypeVI secretion, were not found in MGH78578 (KPK_2042, KPK_3066, KPK_2055, KPK_2056) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p>

As many virulence factors in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> have been proposed based on attenuation of signature-tagged mutants <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Struve1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Lawlor1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, and IVET <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, the presence or absence of these factors in the Kp342 genome were examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t002">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s014">Tables S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s015">S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s016">S13</xref>). A total of 133 nucleotide sequences (93 from Lawlor <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Lawlor1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s014">Table S11</xref>), 16 from Struve <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Struve1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s015">Table S12</xref>), and 20 from Lai <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000141.s016">Table S13</xref>)) were searched against the Kp342 and MGH78578 CDSs using WUBLASTN or against the Kp342 and MGH78578 genomes using BLASTX. Only four examples were found where potential virulence factors were present in Kp342, but absent from MGH78578 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, there were 7 examples based on results of the Lawlor study <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Lawlor1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> where the clinical isolate MGH78578 had significant matches that were missing from the endophyte Kp342 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t002">Table 2</xref>). It is not directly apparent how these mutants affect virulence except for the mutant designated #39-13, which encodes a fimbrial-like protein that may be necessary for attachment to the host.</p>

        <p>The presence of previously described virulence factors in Kp342 encouraged virulence testing in an animal model. To evaluate the pathogenicity of Kp342, the ability of the strain to cause urinary tract and lung infection was investigated by use of mouse models. For comparison, the well-characterized clinical isolate C3091 was included in the study. Kp342 was able to cause urinary tract infections (UTI). Five out of six mice inoculated with strain Kp342 had infected bladders 3 days after inoculation, and the number of bacteria in infected bladders was similar to bladders of mice inoculated with the clinical strain C3091 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t003">Table 3</xref>). Kp342 was also able to ascend to the kidneys, but at a level 28 times lower than the clinical strain, C3091 (<italic>P</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.009).</p>

        <p>All mouse lungs were also infected with Kp342 two days after inhalation, but at a level 49 times less than C3091 (<italic>P</italic>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.015, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t003">Table 3</xref>) thus, it can be concluded that Kp342 causes lung infection, but at a significantly lower level than the infection level caused by C3901. Liver infection was detected in only one of the five mice following Kp342 inoculation compared with three of five mice infected with C3091. The spleen was infected in two of the five mice challenged with C3091 while none of the mice challenged with Kp342 were infected.</p>

        <title>Antibiotic Resistance</title>
        <p>Kp342 has adapted or acquired many mechanisms of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t004">Table 4</xref>). Considering this is a plant isolate with no contact with synthetic or man-made antibiotics, it is surprisingly multidrug resistant to all major drug families tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000141-t004">Table 4</xref>). In contrast to many of the clinical multidrug-resistant isolates studied previously <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Schneiders1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, which use a combination of point mutations and efflux mechanisms, Kp342 uses primarily efflux pumps and beta-lactamase genes to establish resistance to a variety of drugs. None of the classic antibiotic-resistance point mutations could be identified in <italic>gyrA</italic>, <italic>gyrB</italic>, <italic>parC</italic>, <italic>parE</italic>, <italic>folP</italic>, <italic>rpoB</italic> or 23S rRNA genes to account for quinolone, sulfonamide, rifampin and macrolide antibiotics. The genome encodes 4 bona fide beta-lactamase genes (KPK_1541, KPK_2697, KPK_2780 and KPK_2800), 7 genes in the metallo-beta-lactamase family and one beta-lactam resistance protein (<italic>blr</italic>, KPK_2388). Of these, KPK_2780 and KPK_2800 are identical and are part of a tandem duplication event, encompassing nucleotides 2834061-2850989 and 2850989-2867917. These two genes are nearly identical (98.6% identity) to the previously described chromosomally encoded class A beta-lactamase, SHV-1 <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Chaves1" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Two additional CDSs, KPK_1541 and KPK_2697, are both predicted to encode class C beta-lactamases (matching COG1680). Kp342 encodes <italic>ramA</italic> (KPK_4028), a gene previously identified in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> that confers resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, norfloxacin, trimethoprim and puromycin A when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 <xref rid="pgen.1000141-George1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Immediately upstream of this gene is <italic>romA</italic> (KPK_4029), which was originally isolated from <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> as a gene that when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, caused reduced expression of outer membrane proteins, resulting in a multiple drug resistance phenotype (quinolones, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Komatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref> that is independent of OmpF <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Komatsu2" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. This gene has recently been shown to be adjacent to <italic>ramA</italic> in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> G340 during the sequencing of a tigecycline susceptible transposon mutant clone in <italic>ramA</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ruzin1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. RamA has been shown to be a transcriptional activator similar to MarA (KPK_2759) <xref rid="pgen.1000141-George1" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref> that increases expression of the RND-family multidrug efflux pump, AcrAB, (KPK_4236/ KPK_4237) in <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain G340 <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ruzin1" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Kp342 and MGH78578</title>
        <p>Comparative genomic analyses between Kp342 and MGH78578 reveal an overall high degree of similarity between the genomes of the two strains; however, key differences in genetic content have been identified that are likely to be critical influences on their preferred host ranges and lifestyles (endophytic plant associations for Kp342 and presumably human pathogen for MGH78578). One major difference in metabolism is the ability of Kp342 to fix nitrogen which gives this organism an advantage for survival in nitrogen poor environments and favors plant associations <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Danhorn1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Comparative analyses reveal differences in the distribution of fimbrial proteins important to surface attachment and effectors of signaling proteins such as the secondary messanger protein, c-di-GMP, which has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of bacterial traits and responses to environmental stimuli affecting biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides, formation of biofilms, and regulation of virulence genes <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Tamayo1" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Interactions between bacterial surface-associated structures such as polysaccharides and fimbriae are central to the types of bacterial adhesions and range of host cells to which attachment can be accommodated as well as to biofilm formation. Furthermore, the Kp342 HecA-like filamentous haemagglutinin (KPK_4110) protein was found to be unique to Kp342 in the 3-way comparison, with no orthologs in MGH78578. These results coupled with additional dissimilarities between Kp342 and MGH78578 in the distribution of regulatory content such as transcription and sigma factor regulators further suggest that there are important differences in the regulatory networks formed in Kp342 and MGH78578.</p>
        <p>Variations in the distribution of genes related to Type IV and TypeVI secretory function may impact secretion of virulence factors or substances that promote interactions with plants. Finally, dissimilarities in transporter content were noted especially a greater expansion in ABC and MFS transporter families in Kp342 versus MGH78578 which may further effect the nature of compounds including those derived from plants that can be taken up or excreted by Kp342. Collectively, these divergences in nitrogen fixation, surface attachment, regulation and signaling, secretion and transport are likely to assert critical influences on the lifestyles of these two organisms despite generally similar gene content.</p>

        <title>Plant-Induced and Phytobacterial Only Genes</title>
        <p>Comparative genome analyses have elucidated a set of genes in the Kp342 genome that share homology with known plant-induced genes (75) and a set of phytobacterial only genes (23 and 45) with inclusion or exclusion of MGH78578 as a non-phytobacterium, respectively. These gene sets provide important targets for future study to confirm their role in endophytic colonization by Kp342. Many of these plant-induced genes appear to be involved in the adaptation of bacteria to conditions within plant tissue, such as the limitation of amino acid and carbon source concentrations. The importance of amino acid biosynthesis in plant-microbe interactions is supported by the observation that <italic>P. syringae</italic> mutants impaired in the biosynthesis of some amino acids are unable to cause disease symptoms in tomato <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Cuppels1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>. A TPS (KPK_A0226) with similarity to <italic>hecA/B</italic> of <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> was identified in the phytobacteria only gene set, which may be involved in attachment to root surfaces. In <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> KT2440, a non-pathogenic, plant colonizing bacterium, a second TPS (<italic>hlpAB</italic>) was determined to be necessary for competitive root colonization <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Molina1" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. The presence of this additional TPS operon important to colonization by a non-pathogenic plant associated bacteria gives support to the likelihood that the HecA/B homolog in Kp342 plays a prominent role in colonization and is a promising candidate for future study.</p>
        <p>A suite of plant-induced genes have been implicated in bacterial response to oxidative stress and DNA damage due to plant defense responses, several of which are involved in DNA repair and have homologs in the Kp342 genome. For example, the Ada protein is required to activate the transcription of genes involved in adaptive response to DNA methylation damage caused by alkylating agents, and has also been shown to be activated by nitric oxide <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Landini1" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Vasilieva1" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. In addition, exonuclease (<italic>uvrA</italic>) functions in UV induced DNA repair, but has also been shown to participate in hydrogen peroxide and toxic chemical induced DNA damage repair, indicating that this gene may act to protect the bacteria against DNA-damaging compounds produced by plants <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Asad1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Rupp1" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>.</p>
        <p>These oxidative response genes are not limited to DNA repair pathways. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, fumarate hydratase as encoded by <italic>fumC</italic>, and which is part of the TCA cycle, is more highly expressed under conditions when superoxide radicals accumulate <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. An alternative form of fumarate hydratase, encoded by <italic>fum</italic>A, is inactivated under oxidative conditions <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ueda1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Since an early plant defense response involves the increase of ROS, induction of oxidative stress related genes indicate the bacteria are actively evading this defense mechanism while colonizing plants. Acriflavine resistance protein A (<italic>acrA</italic>) is another stress response gene induced upon plant colonization, but does not appear to be triggered by oxidative stress. The product of this gene encodes a component of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump that is important in toxic waste removal in bacteria and shows increased expression under stress conditions <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Helling1" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The roles of the plant-induced gene set described here have been best characterized in plant pathogens. In contrast, the breadth and complexity of plant-bacterial associations beyond that of pathogens is reflected in the small number of phytobacteria-only genes suggesting that no one set of genes can collectively define each of these additional plant associated lifestyles. The role category distribution of the phytobacteria only gene sets determined in this analysis are dominated by hypothetical proteins or proteins of unknown function and genes related to nitrogen fixation. Completion of additional endophytic genomes will be necessary to determine if a core set of genes exclusive to or that defines an endophyte can be established. Further investigations including gene deletion studies in Kp342 will also be necessary to confirm if genes from either the plant-induced or phytobacteria-only gene sets also play a role in endophytic adaptation to plant tissue. Specifically, their actions in colonization and plant defense evasion need to be elucidated.</p>

        <title>Antibiotic Resistance</title>
        <p>Considering Kp342 is not a clinical isolate, the intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms must have been maintained for reasons in addition to antibiotic resistance, such as the removal of toxic plant metabolites, many of which have cyclic ring structures similar to antibiotics. For example, it has been noted previously in <italic>E. coli</italic> that there is a high association of organic solvent (cyclohexane) tolerance with fluoroquinolone resistance mutants, suggesting that bacteria may undergo adaptive responses to organic substances other than quinolones <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Oethinger1" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. More recently, five of ten organic solvent-tolerant <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> clinical isolates overexpressed AcrA and had deletions in the repressor <italic>acrR</italic>
<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Schneiders1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>.

<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Domenico1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1000141-Domenico2" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref> is an unintended consequence of a natural response to the major plant signaling molecule salicylate, which is induced during bacterial pathogenesis and flower development <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Raskin1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Pathogenicity</title>
        <p>In the present study, the pathogenic potential of Kp342 was evaluated in mouse models of urinary tract and lung infection and compared to the clinical strain C3091. Kp342 was found to be as virulent as C3091 regarding the ability to infect the bladder, however although Kp342 was able to ascend to the kidneys, the number of bacteria in infected kidneys were significantly lower compared to C3091. In the lung infection model, all mice inoculated with Kp342 developed lung infections, although the number of bacteria in infected lungs was 49-fold lower compared to C3091. Dissemination of the infection to the liver was seen only in one of the five mice inoculated with Kp342, whereas in the group inoculated with C3091, infection of the liver or spleen was seen in three of the five mice. Compared to the clinical isolate C3091, the lower number of bacteria in infected kidneys and lungs and minor spreading of the infection to other organs indicates that Kp342 is potentially pathogenic, but is less virulent than typical clinical <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> isolates.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>The core theme which defines an endophyte is an ability to live cooperatively within the interior of plant tissues without inducing, or effectively evading plant host defense systems. Comparative genomic analyses in combination with virulence studies in mice have revealed that Kp342 appears to achieve this balance in several ways. For instance, although multiple antibiotic resistance genes and virulence in animals were determined, in general, pathogenicity appears to be attenuated in this strain. Instead genome analyses revealed mechanisms favoring an association with plants. These include not only the capacity to fix nitrogen, but also the presence of metabolic pathways and transport systems well-suited to the recognition and catabolism of plant compounds such as the uptake and degradation of plant derived polysaccharides encompassing cellulosic and aromatic compounds, and survival against ROS and nitric oxide. Further, the distribution of genes essential to surface attachment, secretion, transport, and regulation and environmental signaling, varied between the Kp342 and MGH78578 genomes which may reveal critical divergences between the two strains influencing their preferred host ranges and lifestyles (endophytic plant associations for Kp342 and presumably human pathogen for MGH78578). The analysis reported here and completion of the entire Kp342 genome sequence should serve to catalyze future studies of this organism and provide a new lens through which to view and study the endophytic lifestyle which represents an important but less well-studied form of bacterial-host relationships and one that can potentially be utilized to enhance the growth and nutrition of important agricultural crops. In addition, these results will inform research on <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pathogenesis and development of plant-derived products and biofuels.</p>

        <p>An initial set of open reading frames (ORFs) that likely encode proteins was identified using GLIMMER <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Delcher2" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>, and those shorter than 90 base pairs (bp) as well as some of those with overlaps eliminated. A region containing the likely origin of replication was identified, and base pair 1 was designated adjacent to the <italic>dnaA</italic> gene located in this region <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Bramhill1" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. ORFs were searched against a non-redundant protein database as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>. Frameshifts and point mutations were detected and corrected where appropriate. Remaining frameshifts and point mutations are considered authentic and corresponding regions were annotated as &#x2018;authentic frameshift&#x2019; or &#x2018;authentic point mutation&#x2019;, respectively. The ORF prediction and gene family identifications were completed using the methodology described previously <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>. Two sets of hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to determine ORF membership in families and superfamilies. These included 721 HMMs from Pfam v22.0 and 631 HMMs from the TIGR ortholog resource. TMHMM <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Krogh1" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref> was used to identify membrane-spanning domains (MSD) in proteins. Putative functional role categories were assigned internally as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Fleischmann1" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The nucleotide sequence as well as the corresponding complete manually curated annotations for the closed genome of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> Kp342 were submitted to GenBank under GenomeProject ID #28471.</p>

For binning of phytobacteria-specific protein sequences, unidirectional matches were scored that met the following prerequisites: an E-value of &lt;&#x200A;=&#x200A;1&#xD7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>, &gt;&#x200A;=&#x200A;35% identity, and match lengths of at least 70% of the length of both query and subject. The complete genome of the clinical strain of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> MGH78578 was sequenced by the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University School of Medicine and obtained from NCBI as RefSeq accession NC_009648. The average protein percent identity of Kp342 proteins compared to MGH78578 and <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 was calculated as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Fouts2" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>.

        <title>Phytobacterial Analysis</title>
        <p>An in-house PERL script was used to parse data from Kp342 CDSs searched against an in-house database of 1,720,276 protein sequences from 1050 accessions using WUBLASTP. In order to determine those CDSs found only in only phytobacteria, Kp342 proteins having a significant match to at least one phytobacterial protein but not to any other protein from any other organism in the database were obtained.

        <title>Phylogenetic Analysis</title>
        <p>The phylogenetic analyses were conducted using a system created to automatically generate and summarize phylogenetic trees for each protein for which phylogenetic analysis can be conducted in a genome. The APIS system was used to analyze the Kp342 genome as previously described <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Badger1" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. Each phylogenetic tree is obtained by comparison of a query protein against a curated database of proteins from complete genomes using WUBLAST <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Gish1" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. The full-length sequences of these homologs are then retrieved from the database and aligned using MUSCLE <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>, and bootstrapped neighbor-joining trees are produced using QuickTree <xref rid="pgen.1000141-Howe1" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. An advantage of QuickTree over other phylogenetic tree building programs is that it produces bootstrapped trees with meaningful branch lengths. Next, the inferred tree is midpoint rooted prior to automatic determination of the taxonomic classification of the organisms with proteins in the same clade as the query protein.</p>

Briefly, anaesthetized mice were inoculated transurethrally with 50 &#xB5;l bacterial suspension containing approximately 5&#xD7;10<sup>8</sup> CFU by use of plastic catheters. The catheter was carefully pushed horizontally through the urethral orifice until it reached the top of the bladder, and the bacterial suspension slowly injected into the bladder. The catheter was immediately removed and the mice subjected to no further manipulations until sacrifice. The mice were sacrificed 3 days after inoculation.
