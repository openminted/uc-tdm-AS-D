      <abstract>
        <p>High seed vigor is important for agricultural production due to the associated potential for increased growth and productivity. However, a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is required because the genetic basis for seed vigor remains unknown. We used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for four seed vigor traits in two connected recombinant inbred line (RIL) maize populations under four treatment conditions during seed germination. Sixty-five QTLs distributed between the two populations were identified and a meta-analysis was used to integrate genetic maps. Sixty-one initially identified QTLs were integrated into 18 meta-QTLs (mQTLs). Initial QTLs with contribution to phenotypic variation values of R<sup>2</sup>&gt;10% were integrated into mQTLs. Twenty-three candidate genes for association with seed vigor traits coincided with 13 mQTLs. The candidate genes had functions in the glycolytic pathway and in protein metabolism. QTLs with major effects (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;10%) were identified under at least one treatment condition for mQTL2, mQTL3-2, and mQTL3-4. Candidate genes included a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene (302810918) involved in signal transduction that mapped in the mQTL3-2 interval associated with germination energy (GE) and germination percentage (GP), and an hsp20/alpha crystallin family protein gene (At5g51440) that mapped in the mQTL3-4 interval associated with GE and GP. Two initial QTLs with a major effect under at least two treatment conditions were identified for mQTL5-2. A cucumisin-like Ser protease gene (At5g67360) mapped in the mQTL5-2 interval associated with GP. The chromosome regions for mQTL2, mQTL3-2, mQTL3-4, and mQTL5-2 may be hot spots for QTLs related to seed vigor traits. The mQTLs and candidate genes identified in this study provide valuable information for the identification of additional quantitative trait genes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Seed vigor, an important and complex agronomic trait, is controlled by multiple factors such as genetic and physical purity, mechanical damage, and physiological conditions <xref rid="pone.0092535-Dickson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0092535-Kazmi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Seeds with high vigor can exhibit high germination rates, resistance to environmental stress, and high crop yields <xref rid="pone.0092535-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rodo1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, high-quality seeds that ensure uniform germination and growth that lead to increased production are important to growers, and seed vigor depends fundamentally on the potential of the seed itself to grow under favorable growth conditions and under adverse stress conditions. The ability to predict seed vigor using an artificial aging test is indispensable for ensuring rapid and uniform emergence of plants and for maximizing potential productivity under a wide range of field conditions.</p>
      <p>Sensitivity of seeds to artificial aging has been used successfully to rapidly evaluate and predict seed vigor. High vigor seeds germinate normally after being subjected to artificial aging treatments, but low vigor seeds produce abnormal seedlings or die. Several physiological and biochemical processes have been identified that occur during artificial aging of seeds. For example, oxidative damage to DNA and proteins is likely to be involved in seed aging <xref rid="pone.0092535-Bailly1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and the formation of sugar&#x2013;protein adducts or isoaspartyl residues may be factors contributing to the loss of protein function during artificial aging <xref rid="pone.0092535-Oge1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rajjou1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In contrast, antioxidants, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and enzymes that repair protein damage may be involved in ameliorating the effects of artificial aging on seed vigor <xref rid="pone.0092535-Oge1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Kibinza1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0092535-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Stress-related proteins and enzymes may also play a role in seed vigor. Prieto-Dapena et al. <xref rid="pone.0092535-PrietoDapena1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> reported that seed-specific overexpression of the sunflower heat stress transcription factor HaHSFA9 in tobacco enhanced the accumulation of HSPs and improved resistance of seeds to artificial aging <xref rid="pone.0092535-Almoguera1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Mutations in the rice aldehyde dehydrogenase 7 (OsALDH7) gene resulted in seeds that were more sensitive to artificial aging conditions and accumulated more malondialdehyde than wild-type seeds, implying that this enzyme plays a role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation <xref rid="pone.0092535-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. A high level of a membrane lipid-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PLDa1) appeared to be detrimental to seed quality, but attenuation of PLDa1 expression improved oil stability, seed quality, and seed vigor <xref rid="pone.0092535-Devaiah1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) have also been reported to be involved in seed deterioration <xref rid="pone.0092535-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Overaccumulation of protein-<sc>l</sc>-isoaspartate <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (PIMT1, encoding IAMT in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) reduced the accumulation of <sc>l</sc>-isoaspartyl residues in seed proteins and increased germination vigor. Conversely, reduced PIMT1 accumulation was associated with an increase in the accumulation of <sc>l</sc>-isoaspartyl residues in the proteome of freshly harvested dry mature seeds, resulting in heightened sensitivity to aging treatments and the loss of seed vigor under stressful germination conditions <xref rid="pone.0092535-Oge1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although environmental conditions during seed formation, harvest, and germination are important, genetic factors also have substantial impacts on seed vigor <xref rid="pone.0092535-Bewley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0092535-Contreras2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Genetic loci associated with seed vigor have been identified in rice, barley, wheat, oilseed rape, and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> using artificial aging tests <xref rid="pone.0092535-Clerkx1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Bentsink1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0092535-RehmanArif1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, proteome analyses of seed vigor in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and maize revealed common features in seeds subjected to artificial aging <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rajjou1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To our knowledge, only two reports on proteomic characterization of specific proteins associated with seed vigor have been published. The use of artificial aging treatments to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed vigor by linkage analysis in maize has not been reported. In this study, seed vigor experiments and QTL analyses using two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations and molecular markers were conducted under controlled conditions of seed deterioration to (1) identify QTLs for traits related to seed vigor, (2) integrate the QTLs identified across the two RIL populations to verify true QTLs, and (3) integrate candidate gene analyses with seed vigor QTL mapping across the two populations to assess the roles of candidate genes in natural variations in seed vigor in maize.</p>

        <p>The maize inbred line Shen137 was crossed with two other maize inbred lines, Yu82 and Yu537A, to make two connected F<sub>1</sub> crosses during spring 2005 in Zhengzhou, Henan, China. The two crosses, Yu82 &#xD7; Shen137 and Yu537A &#xD7; Shen137, were self-pollinated by the single seed descent method to produce 208 and 212 F<sub>10</sub> RILs, respectively, designated as Population 1 (Pop. 1) and Population 2 (Pop. 2), which were used to identify QTLs for traits related to seed vigor. Yu82 and Yu537A were derived from a Chinese Stiff Stalk germplasm, a heterotic group used broadly in China, while Shen137 was derived from a Chinese non-Stiff Stalk germplasm, also a heterotic group widely used in China.</p>

        <p>We used an improved method of artificial aging that was proposed originally by Zeng et al. <xref rid="pone.0092535-Zeng2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Sample seeds from the 208 and 212 F<sub>10</sub> RILs and their parent lines were treated at 45&#xB0;C and 90% relative humidity for 0, 2, 4, and 6 days (0 d, 2 d, 4 d, and 6 d, respectively) using a thermostatic moisture regulator. The 0 d treatment was used as a control.</p>

        <title>Germination Experiment and Seed Vigor-related Trait Evaluation</title>
        <p>The germination experiment followed a randomized complete block design with three replications and was conducted at 28&#xB0;C in a growth chamber in 2011. Fine sand with a diameter of 0.05&#x2013;0.2 mm was used as a sprouting bed. The sand was heated at 120&#xB0;C for 2 h in a high-handed sterilization pan containing a 16 &#xD7; 8 array of 40-mm-diameter wells. Two seeds were placed on top of 3.5 cm of sand in each well and then covered with 1.5 cm of sand. Fifty seeds of the parental lines and each RIL were selected to ensure good sowing quality. The seeds were incubated in a growth chamber at 28&#xB0;C, 65% relative humidity, and illumination conditions of 4000 lux and a 14/10 (day/night) photoperiod with three replications. The number of germinated seeds was counted daily. Germination rate data were collected over an 8-day period after sowing and were used for QTL analysis when obvious differences between the parental lines and the RILs were observed. After the 8-day germination period, five plants of each RIL were selected randomly and dried in an oven at 65&#xB0;C for 48 h and then weighed to obtain root dry weight (RDW) and seedling dry weight (SDW). The germination percentage (GP) was calculated as<disp-formula id="pone.0092535.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0092535.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where <italic>n</italic> is the total number of germinated seeds and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of seeds tested. The germination energy (GE) was calculated as the number of germinated seeds on day 4 divided by the total number of seeds.</p>

        <p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to estimate genetic variation among the RILs for all of the traits. To normalize the variance, the germination percent was transformed to<disp-formula id="pone.0092535.e002"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0092535.e002.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>The frequency distribution of the traits was calculated to test the skewness of the traits toward the parents. Pearson correlation coefficients among the traits were computed using the statistical software package SPSS17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using the mean values of each trait.</p>

        <title>Construction of Molecular Marker Genetic Linkage Maps and QTL Analysis</title>
        <p>Young-leaf samples were collected from seedlings of the two connected F<sub>10</sub> RIL populations, and genomic DNA was extracted using the CTAB method <xref rid="pone.0092535-SaghaiMaroof1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Genotype data for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were analyzed using the Genome Studio Data analysis software (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), which generates homozygous and heterozygous genotype clusters. In total, 3072 SNP markers were chosen to detect polymorphisms between the two parental lines, i.e., Yu82/Shen137 and Yu537A/Shen137.</p>
        <p>Molecular genetic linkage maps were constructed with the maximum likelihood mapping function using JoinMap software version 4.0 <xref rid="pone.0092535-VanOoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Analysis of QTLs associated with seed vigor was conducted using composite interval mapping (CIM) with WinQTLcart 2.5 software <xref rid="pone.0092535-Zeng3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The genome was scanned every 2 cM with a window size of 10 cM to exclude control markers around the tested interval <xref rid="pone.0092535-Trachsel1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Five control markers were identified by forward and backward regression. An empirical threshold level for declaring a QTL to be significant was an alpha level of 0.05 for each individual phenotypic trait across all traits. A maximum genetic distance of 50 cM was used to group all markers to chromosomes by performing 1000 random permutations. The phenotypic variation and additive effect explained by each QTL were estimated from the values expressed by the QTL peaks obtained from CIM.</p>
        <p>For the additive effects of the QTLs, positive and negative values indicated that alleles from the normal maize inbreds Yu537A/Yu82 and the maize inbred Shen137, respectively, increased the trait scores. QTLs were named using the following nomenclature: &#x201C;q&#x201D; &#x201C;+&#x201D;artificial aging treatment days &#x201C;+&#x201D;trait abbreviation &#x201C;+&#x201D;population code &#x201C;+&#x201D;&#x2212; &#x201C;+&#x201D;chromosome number &#x201C;+&#x201D;QTL number&#x201D;.</p>

        <title>1QTL Integration and Meta-analysis</title>
        <p>To integrate QTL information for seed vigor-related traits obtained from the two connected RIL populations, the two molecular marker genetic linkage maps were integrated, and consensus QTLs were identified by meta-analysis <xref rid="pone.0092535-Arcade1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The QTLs identified in the two connected RIL populations were projected onto the integrated map using their positions and confidence intervals shared by the two molecular marker genetic linkage maps. Ambiguous markers between the two molecular marker genetic linkage maps were deleted, which improved the accuracy of projection.</p>
        <p>Meta-analysis was performed on the QTL clusters on each chromosome using BioMercator2.1 software <xref rid="pone.0092535-Chardon1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the QTL model on each chromosome <xref rid="pone.0092535-Hirotugu1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. According to the AIC, the QTL model with the lowest AIC value is considered to be a significant model and indicates the number of meta-QTLs (mQTLs). A mQTL was declared only when it was shared by the two RIL populations. The number of mQTLs that gave the best fit to the results of a given linkage group was determined based on a modified AIC. mQTLs were named using the following nomenclature: &#x201C;m&#x201D;+&#x201C;QTL&#x201D;+&#x201C;&#x2212;&#x201D; + &#x201C;chromosome number&#x201D; + &#x201C;&#x2212;&#x201D; + &#x201C;mQTL number.&#x201D; QTL meta-analysis requires independent QTLs for the same trait to be obtained from different plant populations or different environmental conditions <xref rid="pone.0092535-Goffinet1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The Yu82, Yu537A, and Shen137 parental lines, designated P1, P2, and P3, respectively, exhibited clear differences in GE, GP, SDW, and RDW under the various treatment conditions. All four traits showed decreased values for the three parental lines after the 2 d, 4 d, and 6 d artificial aging treatments relative to the control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t001">Table 1</xref>). Using GE as an example, the respective values of GE for P1, P2, and P3 were 0.92, 0.74, and 0.88 for the 0 d treatment (control); 0.80, 0.50, and 0.65 for the 2 d treatment; 0.80, 0.25, and 0.60 for the 4 d treatment; and 0.47, 0.12, and 0.33 for the 6 d treatment. The respective values for GE under the 2 d, 4 d, and 6 d aging treatments decreased relative to the controls by 0.12, 0.12, and 0.45 for Yu82; by 0.22, 0.49, and 0.62 for Yu537A; and by 0.23, 0.28, and 0.55 for Shen137.</p>

        <p>Similar trends for changes in GE, GP, SDW, and RDW in response to artificial aging treatments were observed in the RIL populations relative to the parents. The values of the four traits among the two RIL populations showed a pattern of continuous distribution around the mean (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t001">Table 1</xref>). The range of variability for the traits was large among the RILs and the traits differed substantially in response to the different aging treatments.</p>
        <p>GE, GP, SDW, and RDW values showed significant positive correlations with each other in both of the RIL populations for the control and aging treatments except between SDW and GP, SDW and GE, RDW and GP, and RDW and GE for the control and 2 d aging treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t002">Table 2</xref>). The correlation coefficients of all of the traits were higher for the three artificial aging treatments than for the 0 d control. In addition, phenotypic correlations among different treatments for the same seed vigor-related traits in the two RIL populations were significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Of a total of 3072 SNP markers, 1397 and 1371 were polymorphic between the Yu82/Shen137 and Yu537A/Shen137 parents, respectively. The percentages of missing data in the genotyping of the mapping population across the 1397 and 1371 SNP loci were low at 1.32% and 1.68%, respectively. Statistical tests showed that most of the 2768 SNP markers followed the expected 1&#x2236;1 ratio. Ultimately, two genetic linkage maps consisting of all 10 maize chromosomes allocated to 10 linkage groups were constructed based on 1172 and 1139 SNP markers using Joinmap version 4.0 software <xref rid="pone.0092535-VanOoijen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The total lengths and average intervals were 1629.61 cM and 1.39 cM for Yu82/Shen137 and 1681.75 cM and 1.48 cM for Yu537A/Shen137. The 2768 SNP loci in the two linkage maps were consistent with the chromosome bin locations in the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGDB) maps.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Seed vigor depends on the physiological and genetic potential of the seeds and on the effects of environmental stress conditions that they are exposed to during germination. For maize, plant stand establishment and performance are strongly influenced by seed vigor <xref rid="pone.0092535-TeKrony1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-DeVries1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Producing high-quality seeds to stabilize crop yield poses a challenge for crop breeders, and a key to meeting this challenge is the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying seed vigor traits. Little research has been published to date on the use of artificial aging treatments to clarify the molecular mechanisms associated with seed vigor traits in maize. In this study, two sets of connected RIL populations were evaluated for four seed vigor traits after seeds were subjected to three artificial aging treatments during germination.</p>

        <title>Phenotypic Variation among Parent Inbred Lines and their RILs after Different Aging Treatments</title>
        <p>Because germination is affected by seed vigor, many researchers have used the germination rate as an indicator of seed vigor <xref rid="pone.0092535-Clerkx1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Schwember1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rajjou2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. To predict the ability of seeds to perform under a wide range of field conditions, an artificial aging test was used in this study. The results showed that GE and GP decreased gradually with increasing duration of the artificial aging treatment and that the germination rates differed between the parental lines and the RILs with artificial aging (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t001">Table 1</xref>). In addition, correlations between the results from the untreated controls and the seeds subjected to artificial aging treatments were significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t003">Table 3</xref>), indicating that the artificial aging test provided a valid assessment of seed vigor.</p>

        <title>Genotypic Differentiation in Two Populations Reflects Adaptation to Artificial Aging Conditions</title>
        <p>The selection of maize lines for adaption to climatic conditions has resulted in differences in seed vigor in various inbred lines. These differences in vigor are reflected by differences in responses to artificial aging conditions. Only one common QTL identified in this study was located near the chromosome region associated with GE at bin 3.02, but multiple population-specific QTLs were identified even though the two populations shared Shen137 as a common parent. Specifically, five QTLs on chromosomes 1, 3 (2), 5, and 6 that were contributed by the parental line Yu82 were identified in Pop. 1 and five QTLs on chromosomes 2, 3 (2), 4, and 7 that were contributed by the parental line Yu537A were linked in Pop. 2.</p>
        <p>Among the 18 mQTLs, 9 mQTLs included initial QTLs for GE on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; 8 mQTLs included initial QTLs for GP on chromosomes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; 8 mQTLs included initial QTLs for SDW on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10; and 10 mQTLs included initial QTLs for RDW on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 10.</p>
        <p>The <italic>GP1-3</italic> and <italic>SDW2-3</italic> QTLs identified in Pop. 1 and Pop. 2, respectively, were detected in seeds subjected to control, 2 d, and 4 d treatments, but not the 6 d treatment. The results suggested that the loci associated with seed vigor played an important role during the early stages of seed deterioration caused by artificial aging. The progressive decrease in germination vigor depends on the duration of artificial seed aging <xref rid="pone.0092535-Harman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This may be due to the diverse negative effects of reduced protein synthesis on processes such as maintenance, repair, and normal resumption of metabolism and cell cycle activity, efficiency of detoxification, efficiency of signaling pathways, and/or the production and secretion of metabolites and plant hormones <xref rid="pone.0092535-Harman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Oxidative stress has also been shown to be a causal factor in aging processes <xref rid="pone.0092535-Harman1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The extent of oxidative damage to nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins has been shown to increase with age <xref rid="pone.0092535-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the <italic>GP1-5</italic> QTLs in Pop. 1 were all identified in seeds subjected to control, 2 d, 4 d, and 6 d treatments, with contributions to phenotypic variation of single QTLs ranging from 6.52% to 10.67%. These results indicated that the QTLs confer resistance to high-temperature and humidity conditions, which may deserve further study in marker-assisted selection (MAS). A cucumisin-like Ser protease gene (At5g67360) mapped to the <italic>QTL1-5</italic> interval. Increased protease activities were observed in potato seed-tubers, wheat seeds, and maize seeds during artificial aging, which resulted in a substantial reduction in soluble and storage proteins <xref rid="pone.0092535-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Galleschi1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Notably, <italic>SDW2-2</italic> and <italic>RDW2-2</italic> QTLs in Pop. 2 were identified only with the 2 d, 4 d, and 6 d treatments, indicating that these loci strongly influence plant stand establishment after seed deterioration caused by high-temperature and humidity conditions.</p>

        <title>Synthesis of Initial QTLs across Two Populations Subjected to Different Artificial Aging Treatments</title>
        <p>We examined the genetic correlations among traits by mQTL analysis. Co-localization of QTLs for the traits associated with seed vigor might indicate pleiotropy and/or tight linkage. In this study, 16 mQTLs (e.g., mQTL6-2, mQTL4-3, mQTL2, and mQTL3-2) included two to six initial QTLs for two to four of the seed vigor traits. These initial QTLs might indicate pleiotropy and/or tight linkage. For mQTL2, mQTL3-2, and mQTL3-4, an initial QTL with a major effect (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;10%) was identified for at least one treatment condition, and corresponding candidate genes mapped to the mQTL intervals except for mQTL2. The chromosome regions for three mQTLs with high QTL co-localization might be hot spots of important QTLs for seed vigor traits. Validation of potential candidate genes from the three mQTLs would provide a reliable and feasible strategy for QTL cloning.</p>

Twenty-three differentially expressed proteins were located at bin loci of 13 mQTLs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092535-t006">Table 6</xref>). The proteins had functions related to responses to stress, molecular chaperones, hydrolase activity, energy, cell growth/division, protein targeting and storage, signal transduction, translation, protein metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and other processes. Basavarajappa et al. <xref rid="pone.0092535-Basavarajappa1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> suggested that seed aging affected metabolism and energy supply in maize, while Ching and Schoolcraft <xref rid="pone.0092535-Ching1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> showed that seed storage protein content decreased with seed aging.

        <title>The Glycolytic Pathway is Affected during Artificial Seed Aging</title>
        <p>The functions of eight candidate genes located within the mQTLs identified in seeds subjected to artificial aging treatments were associated with the glycolytic pathway. The functions of two of the candidate genes were associated with stress responses. A stress-responsive glyoxalase family gene (226532762) mapped in the mQTL1-1 interval that was associated with RDW and an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (45238345) mapped in the mQTL6-1 interval that was associated with SDW and GP. The functions of the remaining six candidate genes were associated with energy processes. These genes included an ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha gene (327195227) that mapped in the mQTL3-2 interval associated with GE and GP; a glyceraldehyde 3-P dehydrogenase gene (At3g04120) that mapped in the mQTL4-2 interval associated with GE and RDW; a V-type (H+)-ATPase domain gene (326509331) that mapped in the mQTL4-3 interval associated with GE, SDW, and RDW; a phosphoglucomutase gene (At1g70730) that mapped in the mQTL6-1 interval associated with SDW and GP; a 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene (226247007) that mapped in the mQTL6-2 interval associated with GE, GP, SDW, and RDW; and an isocitrate lyase gene (AT3G21720) that mapped in the mQTL7-2 interval associated with GP and RDW.

        <title>Protein Metabolism is Major a Factor in Seed Vigor during Artificial Seed Aging</title>
        <p>Previous studies showed that that protein metabolism plays an important role in seed germination during artificial seed aging and that several metabolic functions are affected, including protein folding, protein translocation, thermotolerance, oligomeric assembly, and switching between active and inactive protein conformations <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rajjou1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rajjou3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Rajjou and Debeaujon <xref rid="pone.0092535-Rajjou1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> demonstrated that simultaneous impairment of these functions was closely linked to the loss of seed vigor and Prieto-Dapena et al. <xref rid="pone.0092535-PrietoDapena1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> showed that transgenic seeds overexpressing a heat stress transcription factor exhibited increased accumulation of HSPs, resulting in improved resistance to artificial aging treatments in seeds. The preservation of a robust stress response and protein turnover mediated by HSPs is a requirement for all organisms <xref rid="pone.0092535-Sti1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Eight candidate genes identified within mQTLs identified in this study were functionally associated with protein metabolism. Four of the candidate genes had functions related to general protein metabolism or translation, including an elongation factor 1-g2 gene (AT1G57720) that mapped in the mQTL4-3 interval associated with GE, SDW, and RDW; an elongation factor 1B-g gene (AT1G09640) that mapped in the mQTL6-1 interval associated with SDW and GP; a calreticulin 1 gene (AT1G56340) that mapped in the mQTL7-1 interval associated with GE and RDW; and an Asp aminotransferase gene (At5g19550) that mapped in the mQTL3-3 interval associated with SDW and RDW. The other four candidate genes encoded HSPs including a hypothetical ACD ScHsp26-like gene (242056533), an HSP16.9 gene (195605946), an HSP17.2 gene (162459222) that mapped in the mQTL3-1 interval associated with GE and GP, and an hsp20/alpha crystallin family protein gene (At5g51440) that mapped in the mQTL3-4 interval associated with GE and GP. The proteins with chaperone activities encoded by the candidate genes (Hsp26, hsp20, HSP16.9, and HSP17.2) are favored targets for oxidation, presumably because they act as shields to protect other proteins against ROS damage <xref rid="pone.0092535-Cabiscol1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.

        <p>In addition, five candidate genes identified within mQTLs identified in this study were associated with protein modification and signal transduction functions. These genes included a ubiquitin E2 gene (At1g45050) involved in protein modification and a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) gene (302810918) involved in signal transduction, both of which mapped in the mQTL3-2 interval associated with GE and GP; a gene containing a predicted RING-finger domain (224143836) involved in protein targeting and storage that mapped in the mQTL3-3 interval associated with SDW and RDW; a CAAX prenyl protease 1 gene (226508796) with hydrolase activity that mapped in the mQTL4-2 interval associated with GE and RDW; and a cucumisin-like Ser protease (At5g67360) that mapped in the mQTL5-2 interval associated with GP. The RING-finger domain-containing protein (224143836) and the protein-degrading ubiquitin E2 protein (At1g45050) play key roles in the ubiquitination pathway <xref rid="pone.0092535-Joazeiro1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. CaMK (302810918) is active in protein phosphorylation through the transfer of phosphate from ATP to protein substrates. Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in many signaling pathways such those involved in responses to stress caused by cold, heat shock, desiccation, peroxide, salt, or ABA <xref rid="pone.0092535-Lemmon1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. The regulation of CaMK in maize seeds subjected to artificial aging might alter signal transduction.</p>

        <title>Other Pathways Involved in Seed Vigor during Artificial Seed Aging</title>
        <p>Embryo cells undergo active division and expansion during seed germination <xref rid="pone.0092535-azquezRamos1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Seeds germinate much more slowly after artificial aging treatments <xref rid="pone.0092535-Bingham1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, suggesting that these processes related to cell growth might be affected. Two candidate genes had functions related to cell growth and division. A predicted cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) A gene (224061823) mapped in the mQTL1-4 interval associated with RDW and GE and a MEK homolog1 gene (162459414) mapped in the mQTL3-3 interval associated with SDW and RDW. In addition, a lipoprotein gene (195658029) involved in lipid metabolism mapped in the mQTL4-2 interval associated with GE and RDW. CDK and MEK homolog1 play pivotal roles in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. For example, inappropriate activation of CDK can lead to apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0092535-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092535-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the QTLs and the candidate genes identified in this study provide valuable information for identifying additional quantitative trait genes. The alleles for seed vigor could be useful targets for MAS to produce germplasm with improved resistance to artificial aging treatments.</p>
