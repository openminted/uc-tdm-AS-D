      <abstract>
        <p>To ascertain genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among a representative collection of Chinese winter wheat cultivars and lines, 90 winter wheat accessions were analyzed with 269 SSR markers distributed throughout the wheat genome. A total of 1,358 alleles were detected, with 2 to 10 alleles per locus and a mean genetic richness of 5.05. The average genetic diversity index was 0.60, with values ranging from 0.05 to 0.86. Of the three genomes of wheat, ANOVA revealed that the B genome had the highest genetic diversity (0.63) and the D genome the lowest (0.56); significant differences were observed between these two genomes (P&lt;0.01). The 90 Chinese winter wheat accessions could be divided into three subgroups based on STRUCTURE, UPGMA cluster and principal coordinate analyses. The population structure derived from STRUCTURE clustering was positively correlated to some extent with geographic eco-type. LD analysis revealed that there was a shorter LD decay distance in Chinese winter wheat compared with other wheat germplasm collections. The maximum LD decay distance, estimated by curvilinear regression, was 17.4 cM (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.1), with a whole genome LD decay distance of approximately 2.2 cM (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.1, P&lt;0.001). Evidence from genetic diversity analyses suggest that wheat germplasm from other countries should be introduced into Chinese winter wheat and distant hybridization should be adopted to create new wheat germplasm with increased genetic diversity. The results of this study should provide valuable information for future association mapping using this Chinese winter wheat collection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide. In China, wheat is grown on about 24 million hectares with a total annual production of 115 million tons and an average yield of 4.75 tons ha<sup>-1</sup>. Winter wheat occupies about 93% of the area planted in wheat and comprises approximately 94% of total wheat production in 2010 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor">http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx?PageID=567#ancor</ext-link>). Genetic diversity is one of the most important factors for crop improvement. Over the past 60 years, wheat breeders have made remarkable progress in improving grain yield, disease resistance, quality and agronomic performance by using excellent germplasm resources. The recurrent use of a few elite germplasm lines as parental stock, however, has led to a decrease in genetic diversity and has narrowed the genetic base for wheat improvement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hoisington1">[1]</xref>. The degree of genetic diversity found in contemporary germplasm from breeding programs may indirectly reflect the level of genetic progress achievable in future cultivars. Evaluation of wheat genetic diversity is therefore essential to the effective use of genetic resources in breeding programs.</p>
      <p>Knowledge of genetic diversity is important for understanding the extent of genetic variability in existing plant material. Various types of markers can be used for genetic diversity estimation in wheat germplasm. In the past, morphological traits and physiological indexes were widely used for assessing genetic diversity, even though they are influenced by the environment and thus cannot be evaluated accurately. More recently, DNA molecular markers have been increasingly exploited for this purpose. They can be used for marker-assisted selection when tightly linked to target genes, and can also be employed to investigate levels of genetic diversity among categories such as cultivars and closely related species in germplasm banks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Erlich1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Mullis1">[3]</xref>. SSRs (Simple Sequence Repeats), which are among the most important molecular markers, are abundant, highly polymorphic, genome specific, codominant in nature, and show a fairly even distribution over the genome. SSRs have found application in analyses of genetic diversity and population structure, gene mapping, and assisted selection for crop improvement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Akkaya1">[4]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hao1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD), or nonrandom association of alleles between linked or unlinked loci, is becoming increasingly important for identifying genetic regions associated with agronomic traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-FlintGarcia1">[8]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Zhang2">[10]</xref>. Assessing relatedness among accessions is an important prerequisite for the identification of core germplasm collections suitable for optimizing association studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Garris1">[11]</xref>. The presence of population structure has been widely documented in most studies investigating the diversity of elite crop germplasm, especially in self-pollinating cereals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hao1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Barrett1">[12]</xref>. In fact, the characterization of population structure within germplasm collections is critical to identify and correctly interpret the associations between functional and molecular diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Pritchard1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Buckler1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Estimates of LD decay in wheat at the whole genome level and with large genetic representations of wheat genotypes are of great value. From an analysis of 242 genomic SSRs among 43 elite US wheat cultivars, it was reported that genome-wide LD estimates were generally less than 1 cM for genetically linked locus pairs, and that most of the LD was between loci less than 10 cM apart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Chao1">[15]</xref>. A collection of 189 bread wheat accessions genotyped at 370 loci and 93 durum wheat accessions genotyped at 245 loci were used to examine LD across the genome, and it was found that LD mapping of wheat could be performed with SSR markers to a resolution of less than 5 cM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Somers1">[16]</xref>. Estimates of LD at the chromosome level have also been reported. Researchers found consistent LD of less than 1 cM for chromosome 2D and about 5 cM in the 5A centromeric region using 33 and 20 SSR markers, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Breseghello1">[17]</xref>. In another investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Horvath1">[18]</xref>, chromosome 3B had a lower diversity than the average for the entire B-genome. LD was weak in all studied accessions, and marker pairs with significant LD were generally concentrated around the centromere in both arms or at distal positions on the short arm.</p>
      <p>In this study, a representative collection of 90 elite winter wheat accessions from the major wheat production regions of northern China were analyzed using 269 SSR loci distributed over all 21 chromosomes. Our objectives were to estimate the levels of genetic diversity and LD decay distance, and to characterize the population structure of this Chinese winter wheat germplasm collection. The results are intended to provide a molecular basis for understanding Chinese winter wheat genetic diversity, put forward suggestions for further improvement of wheat, and serve as a resource for association mapping using this collection.</p>

        <p>Using 269 SSR markers, genetic diversity of the Chinese winter wheat collection was characterized and evaluated at the genome level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044510-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044510.s003">Table S3</xref>). Among the 269 SSR loci, a total of 1,358 alleles were detected, ranging from 2 to 10 per locus with a mean genetic richness of 5.05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0044510-t001">Table 1</xref>). Genetic diversity index values ranged from 0.05 to 0.86, and the mean genetic diversity index of 0.60 indicated low levels of polymorphism in this winter wheat collection. There were 375 (27.61%) rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5%, indicating that many new alleles were present in this Chinese winter wheat collection.</p>

        <p>Population structure of the 90 accessions was estimated using STRUCTURE V2.3.3 software based on 269 whole-genome unlinked SSR markers. The number of subpopulations (K) was identified based on maximum likelihood and delta K (&#x394;K) values, with accessions falling into three subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Using a membership probability threshold of 0.60, 24 accessions were assigned to subgroup (SG) 1, 27 accessions to SG 2, 13 accessions to SG 3 and 26 accessions were retained in the admixed group (AD). With the maximum membership probability, 36 accessions were assigned to SG 1, 37 accessions to SG 2 and 17 accessions to SG 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The relationship between subgroups derived from STRUCTURE clustering and geographic eco-types of modern cultivars from Northern and Huang-huai winter wheat regions was further analyzed. SG 1 comprised 22 cultivars from the Northern and 11 from the Huang-huai winter wheat region; SG 2 consisted of 4 Northern and 24 Huang-huai cultivars; and SG 3 included 3 from each region. Among these 67 cultivars, 46 (68.66%) could be differentiated using STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

The genetic diversity of 250 Chinese bread wheat accessions, including 93 modern varieties and 157 landraces, was also investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hao1">[7]</xref>. The authors reported an average of 13.1 alleles per locus and a mean genetic diversity of 0.65, and found that landraces had a higher genetic diversity (0.64) than modern varieties (0.628). In our study, genetic diversity was lower because only 11 landraces were included among the 90 accessions. Most genetic diversity analyses on wheat have been undertaken at the whole genome level. In this study, significant difference in genetic diversity among the three genomes was observed. The B genome showed the highest diversity (0.63) and the D genome the lowest (0.56). Similarly result was reported, the average genetic richness, from highest to lowest, was B&gt;A&gt;D, and genetic diversity indexes were ordered B&gt;D&gt;A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hao2">[22]</xref>. Therefore, we have thus determined that there is a lower level genetic diversity in Chinese modern wheat varieties, especially for the D and A genomes. Consequently, introduction of wheat germplasm from other countries into Chinese winter wheat breeding programs has the potential to enhance the genetic diversity of breeding materials. Furthermore, the augmentation of wheat germplasm with chromosomal fragments from wheat-related species via distant hybridization and embryo rescue would greatly increase the genetic diversity of wheat. The utilization of 1B/1R translocation lines was seen as one of the most successful cases in wheat breeding. The genetic diversity of a worldwide set of 161 winter and spring triticale lines was investigated by genotyping with high-density DArT markers, and higher polymorphic information content (PIC) in triticale was observed while compared to wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Alheit1">[23]</xref>. As triticale is closely related to wheat with the A and B genome, it may be more advantageous than other wheat-related species for wheat germplasm innovation.</p>

        <title>Population Structure</title>
        <p>Population structure is one of several important factors that strongly influence LD. The presence of population stratification and an unequal distribution of alleles within groups can result in nonfunctional spurious associations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-FlintGarcia1">[8]</xref>. Population structure analyses have indicated that wheat accessions can be categorized by geographical origin or be divided into landraces and modern varieties. Using the maximum membership probability in STRUCTURE, 36 accessions were assigned to SG 1, 37 to SG 2, and 17 to SG 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). UPGMA cluster analysis demonstrated that the 90 accessions could also be clearly divided into three groups, and the assignment of 84 accessions (93.33% of the total) by UPGMA clustering was consistent with their classification using STRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Principal coordinate analysis also separated the 90 accessions into three major groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These results confirmed that population structure, comprising three subgroups, actually existed within the 90 accessions. In this study, 46 of the 67 cultivars from Northern and Huang-huai winter wheat regions (68.66%) could be assigned to two subgroups derived from STRUCTURE clustering; similar results were obtained by UPGMA cluster and principal coordinate analyses. This indicates that the population structure was positively correlated with geographic eco-type.</p>
        <p>With a membership probability threshold of 0.60, 24 accessions were assigned by STRUCTURE to SG 1, 27 to SG 2, 13 to SG 3, and 26 to the admixed group (AD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). According to UPGMA cluster analysis results, all 90 accessions grouped together into one class when the genetic distance was about 0.376 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests a low level of genetic diversity, consistent with the genetic diversity estimation obtained using PowerMarker software.</p>
        <p>Although there were only 11 landraces and 6 introduced germplasm representatives in this study, principal coordinate analysis indicated that they differed to some extent from cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g003">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g005">5</xref>). In addition, UPGMA cluster and principal coordinate analyses revealed that the sampled landraces and introduced germplasm varieties had higher diversity than modern cultivars.</p>
        <p>Population structure is an important component in association mapping analyses between molecular markers and traits because it may reduce both type I and II errors. All three population structure approaches, i.e., STRUCTURE, UPGMA, and principal coordinate analysis, showed a more-or-less positive correlation between population structure and geographic eco-types. Because the population structure revealed by STRUCTURE analysis based on many SSR markers distributed throughout the wheat genome was more accurate than using geographic eco-type information, this program was concluded to be the most suitable for investigating population genetic structure.</p>

        <title>Linkage Disequilibrium</title>
        <p>It is important to estimate LD decay distances when carrying out association mapping. The LD decay distance determines the marker density needed to effectively associate genotypes with traits and influences the precision of association mapping. A higher level of LD might be expected in hexaploid wheat than in maize and sorghum because of the rapid rate of inbreeding in wheat with a high degree of self-pollination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-FlintGarcia1">[8]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Numerous studies in wheat have reported LD decay distances. Mean genome-wide LD decay was estimated to be 10 cM (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.1) in 205 U.S. elite wheat breeding lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Zhang1">[6]</xref>. In another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hao1">[7]</xref>, Chinese modern varieties displayed a wider average LD decay than landraces across the whole genome for locus pairs with r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.05 (P&lt;0.001); mean LD decay distance for 157 landraces at the whole genome level was 5 cM compared with 5&#x2013;10 cM for the 93 modern varieties investigated. For 189 bread wheat and 93 durum wheat accessions, the LD between adjacent locus pairs extended (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.2) approximately 2&#x2013;3 cM on average, and it was suggested that LD mapping of wheat could be performed with SSRs to a resolution of &lt;5 cM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Somers1">[16]</xref>. From an analysis of 242 genomic SSRs among 43 elite U.S. wheat cultivars, it was reported that genome-wide LD estimates generally were less than 1 cM for genetically linked locus pairs with r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.2 (P&lt;0.01), and that most LD was less than 10 cM apart between loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Chao1">[15]</xref>. Recently, LD decay distances of 161 diverse winter and spring triticale genotypes assayed was estimated using 2,079 genome-wide distributed DArT markers; a similar LD decay distance within approximately 12 cM was observed for the A and B genome and a lower LD with approximately 5 cM was found in the R genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Alheit1">[23]</xref>. In our study, the maximum LD decay distance (r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.1) was 17.4 cM, with an average LD decay distance of about 2.2 cM for the whole Chinese winter wheat genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This overall LD decay distance was shorter than that reported for other studies. As may been seen from the above-mentioned studies, reported LD decay distances vary greatly from one study to the next. These differences are due both to variations in material type and quantity as well as differences in r<sup>2</sup> values (i.e., r<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.05, 0.1, or 0.2) used for the estimations. Most LD decay distances were estimated with r<sup>2</sup>&#x200A;=&#x200A;0.1.</p>
        <p>Our results also demonstrate that LD decay distances differ among the three wheat genomes &#x2013; the LD decay distance in A, B and D genomes of wheat was about 2.2, 0.6 and 8.6 cM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044510-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The highest extent of LD was observed in the wheat D genome than A and B genomes. Similar result was reported, the linkage disequilibrium (LD) evaluated on 1536 SNPs among 478 spring and winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) cultivars from 17 populations across the United States and Mexico revealed that the highest extent of significant LD was observed in the wheat D genome, followed by lower LD in the A and B genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Chao2">[24]</xref>. Major concerns with LD analyses were at the chromosome level as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Hao1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Breseghello1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Horvath1">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In summary, this study demonstrates that genetic diversity in Chinese winter wheat, especially on D and A genomes, is lower than that of many other wheat germplasm collections. Continuous introduction of wheat germplasm from other countries and the adoption of distant hybridization technology to create new wheat germplasm are necessary to increase genetic diversity. The population structure revealed using STRUCTURE analysis of many SSR markers distributed throughout the wheat genome was more accurate than using geographic eco-type information and was available for investigating population genetic structure. LD analysis revealed that LD decay distance is shorter in Chinese winter wheat compared with other wheat collections. The development of high-density markers in these varieties will thus be required for association mapping.</p>

The accessions comprised 73 cultivars and 11 landraces from 13 provinces of major wheat production regions in China, as well as 6 varieties introduced from other countries. Of the 73 modern cultivars, there were 38 from the Huang-huai winter wheat region, 29 from the Northern region, 5 from the Southwestern region, and 1 from the Yangtze River region. The 11 landraces, which have been widely used in breeding programs, were obtained from Henan, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces. The six introduced cultivars were Jubilejna 1, Early Premium, Lovrin 10, Akagomughi, Norin 10 and Suwon 86, all important parents used in Chinese wheat breeding.</p>

For each K, ten runs were performed separately, with 100,000 iterations carried out for each run after a burn-in period of 10,000 iterations. A K value was selected when the estimate of lnPr(X|K) peaked in the range of 1 to 12 subpopulations. The model choice criterion to detect the most probable value of K was &#x394;K, which is an ad hoc quantity related to the second order change of the log probability of data with respect to the number of clusters inferred by STRUCTURE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0044510-Evanno1">[30]</xref>. The run with the maximum likelihood was applied to subdivide the varieties into different subgroups using a membership probability threshold of 0.60 as well as the maximum membership probability among subgroups.
