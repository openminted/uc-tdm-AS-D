      <abstract>
        <p>Hybrid chlorosis, a type of hybrid incompatibility, has frequently been reported in inter- and intraspecific crosses of allopolyploid wheat. In a previous study, we reported some types of growth abnormalities such as hybrid necrosis and observed hybrid chlorosis with mild or severe abnormalities in wheat triploids obtained in crosses between tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon and four <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> accessions and in their derived synthetic hexaploids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid chlorosis are not well understood. Here, we compared cytology and gene expression in leaves to characterize the abnormal growth in wheat synthetics showing mild and severe chlorosis. In addition, we compared disease resistance to wheat blast fungus. In total 55 and 105 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 53 and 89 genes for defense responses were markedly up-regulated in the mild and severe chlorosis lines, respectively. Abnormal chloroplasts formed in the mesophyll cells before the leaves yellowed in the hybrid chlorosis lines. The plants with mild chlorosis showed increased resistance to wheat blast and powdery mildew fungi, although significant differences only in two, third internode length and maturation time, out of the examined agricultural traits were found between the wild type and plants showing mild chlorosis. These observations suggest that senescence might be accelerated in hybrid chlorosis lines of wheat synthetics. Moreover, in wheat synthetics showing mild chlorosis, the negative effects on biomass can be minimized, and they may show substantial fitness under pathogen-polluted conditions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Allopolyploid speciation, which is one of the major evolutionary processes in higher plants [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], is achieved through various processes including interspecific hybrid formation and endoreduplication. In interspecific crosses, the hybrid plants sometimes break down, a phenomenon called hybrid incompatibility. Hybrid incompatibility inhibits allopolyploid speciation. Common wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L., 2n = 6x = 42, genome constitution AABBDD) is an allohexaploid species derived through allohexaploidization between cultivated tetraploid wheat (<italic>Triticum turgidum</italic> L., 2n = 4x = 28, AABB genome) and wild diploid progenitor <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> Coss. (2n = 2x = 14, DD genome) [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hexaploid wheat plants with the AABBDD genome can be obtained through artificial hybrids (2n = 3x = 21, ABD genome) between tetraploid wheat and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic>, called synthetic hexaploid wheat [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Growth incompatibilities were first reported half a century ago in ABD triploids [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recently, the tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon (Ldn) was found to be an efficient AB genome parent for the production of synthetic hexaploid wheat [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Numerous synthetic wheat hexaploids have been produced from ABD hybrids between Ldn and various <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> accessions [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], whereas several types of hybrid growth abnormalities were observed in many cross combinations [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The incompatibilities between the wheat AB and D genomes include hybrid chlorosis, severe growth abortion, and two types of hybrid necrosis (type II and type III necrosis), which function as postzygotic reproductive barriers preventing the production of synthetic hexaploid wheat [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cell death occurs gradually beginning with older tissues in hybrid lines showing type III necrosis, whereas type II necrosis lines show a necrotic phenotype under low temperature conditions [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Most hybrid incompatibilities are caused by interaction of at least two loci or alleles, a basis of the Dobzhansky-Muller model [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hybrid necrosis is generally triggered by autoimmune response, and the causal genes encode disease resistance-related proteins in higher plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and lettuce [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The up-regulation of defense-related genes such as pathogen-related genes is observed in plants exhibiting hybrid weakness as well as hybrid necrosis, and the causal genes for hybrid weakness are also disease resistance genes in rice [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In ABD triploids, the programmed cell death of severe growth abortion and two types of hybrid necrosis, type II and III necrosis, is accompanied by a significant increase in expression of defense-related genes [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Up to now, no gene expression profiles of ABD hybrid plants showing hybrid chlorosis have been reported. Leaves of the hybrid plants exhibiting chlorosis gradually turn yellowish with age. Four <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> accessions reportedly induce hybrid chlorosis in ABD triploids crossed with Ldn [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The chlorosis phenotype is different from that of the hybrid chlorosis observed in interspecific crosses between a few accessions of cultivated emmer wheat (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> ssp. <italic>dicoccon</italic> (Schrank) Thell., AABB genome) and many accessions of cultivated and wild timopheevii wheat (<italic>Triticum timopheevii</italic> Zhuk., AAGG genome); hybrid chlorosis in tetraploid wheat is lethal [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hybrid chlorosis between <italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>timopheevii</italic> is controlled by two dominant complementary genes, <italic>Cs1</italic> on chromosome 5A and <italic>Cs2</italic> on chromosome 4G [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, interaction between <italic>Ch1</italic> on 2A and <italic>Ch2</italic> on 3D induces hybrid chlorosis with lethality [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, three chlorophyll-related abnormalities, striato-virescence, delayed virescence, and albino, are triggered by complementary gene interactions on chromosomes 2A, 3A, or 2B in tetraploid wheat [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Wheat plants showing striato-virescence and delayed virescence are viable and fertile, although albinos are not.</p>
      <p>Intraspecific hybrids with severe growth defects show enhanced disease resistance, and in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the enhanced resistance is related to activation of the salicylic acid (SA) stress signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most plant lesion mimic mutants with either necrotic or chlorotic lesions have activated defense responses and show increased resistance to virulent pathogens compared with wild-type plants [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Reduced growth in the increased-resistance plants is assumed to be due to the high cost for maintenance of defense response-related pathways [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the ABD triploids with growth abnormalities, phenotypic effects of hybrid chlorosis seem milder than hybrid necrosis and severe growth abortion [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The objectives of this study were: 1) to clarify transcriptional and physiological characteristics of hybrid chlorosis of the ABD triploids, 2) to map one of the causal genes for hybrid chlorosis on the wheat D-genome chromosome, and 3) to evaluate the level of disease resistance. Based on these results, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism inducing hybrid chlorosis, and discussed the relationship between growth defects due to hybrid incompatibility and enhanced disease resistance in ABD triploid wheat.</p>

        <title>Phenotype of hybrid chlorosis in triploid wheat hybrids and wheat synthetics</title>
        <p>Triploid plants between Ldn and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> that showed hybrid chlorosis were fertile, and produced selfed seeds, from which synthetic hexaploids with 42 chromosomes germinated. Two synthetic hexaploid lines, Ldn/KU-2111 and Ldn/KU-20-1, showed an identical chlorosis phenotype, whereas the chlorosis phenotype of another Ldn/IG47202 hexaploid line was milder (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the two former chlorosis lines (severe chlorosis), yellowish lesions or sectors appeared on the leaf surface gradually starting with older tissues, and then the leaves turned brown. The yellowish sectors appeared similarly, in an age-dependent manner, and the color change to brown was not observed until senescence began in the distal part of leaves in Ldn/IG47202 (mild chlorosis) (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The phenotype of these hybrid chlorosis lines was not lethal, and selfed seed progeny could be obtained.</p>

        <title>Chromosomal location of the causal gene for hybrid chlorosis</title>
        <p>The severe chlorosis line Ldn/KU-2111 was crossed with the mild chlorosis line Ldn/IG47202 for allelism test, and 156 F<sub>2</sub> plants obtained from the cross were grown in the 2011&#x2013;2012 season. The F<sub>1</sub> plants seemed to show the severe chlorosis phenotype and no F<sub>2</sub> progeny without any chlorosis symptoms was observed, indicating that the causal gene for severe chlorosis was closely linked or overlapped with that for mild chlorosis in the D genome.</p>
        <p>To assign the D-genome causal gene for severe chlorosis, 96 F<sub>2</sub> plants from a cross of Ldn/PI476874, showing normal growth phenotype without any chlorosis symptoms (wild type, WT), and Ldn/KU-2111 were used as a mapping population. In the F<sub>2</sub> mapping population, 70 plants with chlorosis symptoms and 26 WT plants were observed. The chlorosis-inducing allele was dominant, and the segregation ratio statistically fitted a 3:1 ratio (&#x3C7;<sup>2</sup> value = 0.637, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), which was consistent with Mendelian segregation of alleles of a single gene.</p>
        <p>A single locus that controlled hybrid chlorosis in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> was assigned to the short arm of chromosome 7D in the Ldn/PI476874//Ldn/KU-2111 population (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The locus related to induction of chlorosis was mapped together with 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, 4 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers, and <italic>Lr34</italic>. The four CAPS and three SSR markers were respectively developed based on reference to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> and survey sequence data for 7DS [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

        <title>Alteration of gene expression profiles in hybrid chlorosis</title>
        <p>To comprehensively compare gene expression profiles among WT (Ldn/PI476874) and the two hexaploid synthetics showing hybrid chlorosis (Ldn/IG47202 and Ldn/KU-2111), transcriptome analysis was performed using a wheat-specific 38k oligo DNA microarray [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For hybridization, total RNA was extracted from the oldest leaves of 3-week-old seedlings grown at normal temperature (23&#xB0;C). After hybridization with the RNA samples, probes showing at least a threefold difference in signal intensity compared to the WT were defined as either up- or down-regulated genes.</p>
        <p>Of the 37,826 probes on the wheat microarray, 1,663 (4.4%) and 3,864 (10.2%) probes were regarded as genes up- and down-regulated, respectively, in leaves of the mild chlorosis line (Ldn/IG47202) compared with the WT line (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In the severe chlorosis line (Ldn/KU-2111), 2,421 (6.4%) and 2,130 (5.6%) probes were found to be up- and down-regulated, respectively.</p>

        <p>Based on homology searches of the wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) database with probe sequences, 625 (37.6%) and 1,760 (45.5%) of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, were categorized into a total of 17 groups based on inferred function (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Of the up-regulated genes, carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were the most frequently encountered (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Genes related to defense, stress, transcription factors, and transport were also abundantly expressed in the hybrid plants showing mild chlorosis. In contrast, genes related to transport, DNA binding, photosynthesis, and cell maintenance were down-regulated in these plants. Similarly, 947 (39.1%) and 786 (36.9%) genes were up- and down-regulated in the severe chlorosis line, respectively. Carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were the most frequently found to be up-regulated, whereas photosynthesis-related genes were the most dramatically down-regulated in the severe chlorosis plants.</p>
        <p>Among the carbohydrate metabolism-related genes, beta-glucosidase, beta-1,3-glucanase precursor genes and beta-fructofuranosidase were highly up-regulated in the chlorotic plants (Tables <xref rid="pone.0121583.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121583.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In addition, transcripts of a number of defense-related genes, including chitinase and sulfur-rich/thionin-like protein genes, accumulated abundantly in the chlorotic plants. Moreover, many WRKY-type transcription factor genes, which play important roles in immune responses, senescence, and various other processes of plants [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], were found among the up-regulated transcription factor genes in both chlorosis lines (Tables <xref rid="pone.0121583.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121583.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In the severe hybrid chlorosis line, three NAC transcription factor genes including <italic>NAM-B1</italic>, which is associated with senescence and nutrient remobilization from leaves to developing grains [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], were up-regulated (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In both hybrid chlorosis lines, photosynthesis-related genes showed a high rate of down-regulation, including the genes for photosystem I and photosystem II proteins, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase activase.</p>

        <title>Comparison of gene expression profiles between wheat synthetics displaying chlorosis and necrosis</title>
        <p>We compared gene expression profiles among the hybrid chlorosis lines and a type III necrosis line, which was a synthetic wheat line of Ldn/KU-2828 [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The signal-intensity differences of all probes relative to WT signals were compared among leaves showing mild and severe hybrid chlorosis and type III hybrid necrosis. Significantly strong positive correlations were detected between the mild and severe hybrid chlorosis lines and between the severe hybrid chlorosis and type III necrosis lines (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). However, no correlation of signal intensity was observed between leaves showing mild chlorosis and type III necrosis (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

        <p>Moreover, the expression profiles of the severe and mild hybrid chlorosis and type III necrosis lines were compared using defense-, carbohydrate metabolism-, and photosynthesis-related probes in which expression levels were changed for each growth abnormality relative to WT (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121583.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0121583.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables). Significant positive correlations were observed between the profiles of the defense-related genes in mild and severe chlorosis and between the profiles of these genes in hybrid chlorosis and type III necrosis. Similar observations were found in the expression profiles of carbohydrate metabolism-related genes between mild and severe chlorosis. In photosynthesis-related genes, however, significant positive correlations were detected in some of the combinations.</p>

        <p>In the Ldn/PI476874//Ldn/KU-2111 population, significant differences between the WT and chlorosis F<sub>2</sub> individuals were found in all examined traits except for spike length (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The severe chlorosis plants showed a phenotype of reduced height, low seed fertility, small seed weight, and late flowering compared with the WT plants. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in most examined traits between the WT and mild chlorosis plants. Significant reductions in third internode length and delay of maturation time were detected in the mild chlorosis plants.</p>

        <title>Disease resistance in hybrid chlorosis lines</title>
        <p>A number of defense-related genes were up-regulated in the hybrid chlorosis lines, as revealed by microarray analyses (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For evaluation of disease resistance to a <italic>Triticum</italic> isolate, Br48, of the blast fungus (<italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, syn. <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], two WT synthetic wheat lines, Ldn/CGN10768 and Ldn/PI476874, and two showing chlorosis, Ldn/IG47202 and Ldn/KU-2111, were inoculated with Br48. As previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], green and brown infection types are respectively considered to be susceptible (or virulent) and resistant (or avirulent). In all examined lines, 1- and 2-week-old seedlings showed infection types 4G and 5G [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], meaning that these seedlings were susceptible to Br48 (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). However, the infection types of 3-week-old seedlings were 1B, 2B, and 4B in both chlorosis lines but not in the WT synthetic lines. These observations clearly indicated that the hybrid chlorosis-showing plants were more resistant to the wheat blast fungus than the WT plants at the 3-week-old seedling stage.</p>

        <p>To examine the effects of hybrid chlorosis on disease resistance, we compared cellular responses to the wheat blast fungus in the first leaves of mild chlorosis and WT lines of synthetic wheat. The inoculated leaves were fixed 48 h after inoculation with Br48, and observed under a fluorescent microscope. Appressoria of Br48 formed on epidermal cells of the leaves (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). In some attacked cells, the hypersensitive reaction (HR) occurred, which was accompanied by strong yellow fluorescence as previously observed [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In other cells with no fluorescence, no resistance reaction to the appressorial penetration was observed, and infection hyphae were well developed (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

        <p>In most attacked epidermal cells of the highly susceptible barley cultivar Nigrate, HR was rarely observed and the infection hyphae were successfully developed (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The WT and hybrid chlorosis lines of wheat synthetics showed partial resistance to Br48, and HR was observed in the first leaves of 1-, 2-, 3-week-old seedlings. HR was more frequently observed in 2- and 3-week-old seedlings of the mild chlorosis line than in those of the WT synthetic wheat line (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The HR frequency was dramatically increased from one to two weeks after seed sowing in the mild chlorosis line. The significant differences in cellular responses to Br48 infection indicated that seedlings of the mild chlorosis line are more resistant to Br48 than the WT.</p>

        <p>Moreover, we examined the defense response to an isolate, Th-1, of the wheat powdery mildew fungus (<italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>) in the first leaves of mild chlorosis and WT lines of synthetic wheat. The WT synthetic wheat line Ldn/PI476874 showed clear powdery mildew resistance to Th-1 (<xref rid="pone.0121583.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.). Since Ldn was completely sensitive to Th-1, the resistance of Ldn/PI476874 would be transmitted from the parental <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> accession PI476874 which revealed also clear resistance to Th-1. The mild chlorosis line Ldn/IG47202 showed the necrotic cell death on leaves. The area and number of the necrotic lesions decreased in the three-week-old plants of Ldn/IG47202 in which the yellow lesions started to appear. No necrotic lesion appeared on non-infected leaves in Ldn/IG47202, and thus the necrotic lesions were generated by the infection of Th-1. These observations suggested that the area and number of the necrotic lesions were negatively correlated with appearance of the yellow lesions in the mild chlorosis line of synthetic wheat.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Allopolyploidy provides advantages to establishment of new plant species, including fixation of heterosis [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, hybrid growth abnormalities, observed frequently in interspecific crosses, inhibit allopolyploid speciation. Hybrid chlorosis, observed in some cross combinations between tetraploid wheat and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic>, is recognized as one such growth abnormality in allohexaploid wheat speciation [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In hybrid chlorosis lines of synthetic allohexaploid wheat, yellowish lesions and sectors on the leaf surface appear gradually in older tissues. In type III necrosis, necrotic cell death also gradually begins from older tissues, whereas the lesion color is clearly different from that in hybrid chlorosis. In type III necrosis, necrotic cell death is triggered by an HR-like reaction and accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Within the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells in leaves undergoing type III necrosis, oil droplets, meaning plastoglobuli, are more frequently found than in leaves of WT. In addition, plasmolysis, collapse of vacuoles, and organelle degradation are observed as typical features of dead cells in type III necrosis. Unlike type III necrosis, in leaves developing chlorosis, abnormal chloroplasts were found within mesophyll cells (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Plastoglobuli appeared before the yellowish sectors formed on the leaf surfaces of the plants showing hybrid chlorosis. Shrinkage of the chloroplasts occurred, with appearance of many plastoglobuli. This ultrastructural modification of chloroplasts is compatible with the typical features of hybrid chlorosis in the wheat synthetics, which is different from the features of type III necrosis.</p>
      <p>It was previously reported that an increased number of plastoglobuli accompanies thylakoid breakdown during senescence [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, oxidative stress to the photosynthetic apparatus increases the number of plastoglobuli [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, an increase in the number of plastoglobuli seems to be due to generation of reactive oxygen species in chloroplasts of leaves with type III necrosis [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In comparative transcriptome analyses, the gene expression profile of plants showing hybrid chlorosis, especially severe chlorosis, resembled that of type III necrosis (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121583.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Up-regulation of defense- and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes was commonly observed in severe and mild hybrid chlorosis and type III necrosis, which suggested that these hybrid incompatibilities could at least partly share common mechanisms to induce their symptoms. The number of genes detected with defense-related probes showing expression up-regulated at least 3 times more than in WT was more abundant for type III necrosis than hybrid chlorosis, whereas the number of up-regulated probes related to carbohydrate metabolism was more abundant for hybrid chlorosis than type III necrosis (Tables <xref rid="pone.0121583.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121583.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121583.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In the hybrid chlorosis lines, senescence-associated genes and <italic>NAM-B1</italic> were greatly up-regulated. <italic>NAM-B1</italic>, encoding a NAC transcription factor, functions to control leaf senescence and is associated with grain protein, zinc, and iron contents [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The rice <italic>NAM-B1</italic> homologs also act as regulators of leaf senescence [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, these expression profiles showed that hybrid chlorosis resulting from interaction between the AB and D wheat genomes has unique features distinct from hybrid necrosis, and suggests that senescence might be accelerated in the hybrid chlorosis lines of wheat synthetics. Abnormal chloroplasts are accompanied by an increase in the number of plastoglobuli generated in green leaves of the hybrid chlorosis line, and chloroplast degradation was observed in the yellowish leaves (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These TEM observations also supported the idea that accelerated senescence occurs in leaves of the hybrid chlorosis lines.</p>
      <p>Hybrid incompatibility between two diverging lineages is generally explained by interaction of at least two loci or alleles [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The hybrid chlorosis observed in some crosses between tetraploid wheat and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> appears to be due to an epistatic interaction of two loci from the AB and D wheat genomes, considered to be a Dobzhansky-Muller-type hybrid barrier [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several complementary genes for chlorophyll abnormalities have been studied in wheat. The <italic>Ch1</italic> hybrid chlorosis gene has been assigned to chromosome 2A in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, and <italic>Ch2</italic> to chromosome 3D in hexaploid wheat [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hybrid chlorosis in some interspecific crosses of tetraploid wheat is respectively controlled by <italic>Cs1</italic> and <italic>Cs2</italic> on chromosomes 5A and 4G [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Three additional chlorophyll abnormalities are caused by the following complementary gene interactions: <italic>sv1</italic> (3A) and <italic>sv2</italic> (2A), <italic>dv1</italic> (2B) and <italic>dv2</italic> (supposedly 2A), and <italic>abn1</italic> (2A) and <italic>abn2</italic> (2B) in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>turgidum</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The D genome-located causal gene, <italic>Hch1</italic>, for hybrid chlorosis in ABD triploids and wheat synthetics was assigned to the short arm of chromosome 7D (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, <italic>Hch1</italic> is a novel gene inducing hybrid chlorosis in <italic>Triticum</italic> species. We propose the presence of a gene, <italic>Hch2</italic>, in the AB genome of tetraploid wheat, which acts as a gene complementary to <italic>Hch1</italic> for hybrid chlorosis in ABD triploids. Although many complementary pairs of hybrid chlorosis genes have been reported, no locus has been successfully cloned in wheat. To understand the molecular basis of and physiological changes in hybrid chlorosis, map-based cloning of these causal genes would be required in future studies. In our previous study, a causal gene for type III necrosis in the D genome, <italic>Nec1</italic>, was also assigned to 7DS [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>Hch1</italic> was located at a similar chromosomal region to <italic>Nec1</italic>. Because <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> accessions inducing type III necrosis are genealogically distinct from those inducing hybrid chlorosis [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the <italic>Hch1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> alleles could have independently arisen in the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> population. Many disease resistance genes such as <italic>Lr34</italic> are concentrated around the <italic>Hch1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> region of 7DS [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Most causal genes that have been isolated to date are related to disease resistance [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which suggests that <italic>Hch1</italic> and <italic>Nec1</italic> may be any of the disease resistance genes located in the 7DS region.</p>
      <p>In the hybrid chlorosis lines examined in the present study, a lot of WRKY transcription factor genes were up-regulated (Tables <xref rid="pone.0121583.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121583.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The putative <italic>Hch1</italic>-<italic>Hch2</italic> interaction should activate multiple WRKY transcription factors in the hybrid chlorosis plants. WRKY transcription factors play important roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses and senescence in higher plants [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In particular, many <italic>WRKY</italic> genes have been identified to act as positive regulators of SA-dependent immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In rice, for example, <italic>OsWRKY45</italic> functions to regulate disease resistance against the rice blast fungus [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A number of defense-related genes, such as <italic>PR1</italic>, were also up-regulated in the hybrid chlorosis plants (<xref rid="pone.0121583.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which could be at least partly controlled through activation of <italic>WRKY</italic> genes in these plants. Many <italic>WRKY</italic> genes are activated not only in hybrid chlorosis lines but also in wheat ABD triploids showing hybrid necrosis and severe growth abortion [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The direct targets of the epistatic interaction of causal genes for these types of hybrid incompatibility should be studied to clarify the signaling pathways for transcriptional activation of the <italic>WRKY</italic> genes in the abnormal ABD triploid plants.</p>
      <p>Few significant differences in agricultural traits were found in WT synthetic wheat plants and those showing mild chlorosis, although remarkable growth inhibition was observed in plants showing severe chlorosis (<xref rid="pone.0121583.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Transcripts of defense-related and <italic>WRKY</italic> genes accumulated abundantly in leaves of the plants showing mild chlorosis, which in fact showed enhanced resistance to the wheat blast fungus through HR (Tables <xref rid="pone.0121583.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121583.t008" ref-type="table">8</xref>). The enhanced levels of wheat blast disease resistance were correlated with progress of chlorosis symptoms (Tables <xref rid="pone.0121583.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121583.t008" ref-type="table">8</xref>). In addition, we confirmed disease resistance to wheat powdery mildew fungus. The WT synthetic wheat line used in the disease resistance assay unfortunately showed clear wheat powdery mildew resistance because the powdery mildew resistance gene was transmitted from the parental <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>tauschii</italic> accession PI476874, whereas the powdery mildew resistance also appeared to be enhanced in the mild chlorosis line of synthetic wheat (<xref rid="pone.0121583.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>.). Such enhanced disease resistance to wheat blast and powdery mildew fungi was visibly confirmed in three-week-old plants of the mild chlorosis line in which the yellow lesions started to appear. These observations strongly suggest that the level of disease resistance is greatly strengthened in the mild chlorosis plants through up-regulation of defense-related genes. Generally, hybrid necrosis extensively inhibits plant growth and dramatically reduces yield, even if SA-dependent immune responses are activated in plants showing these symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which is an undesirable effect for crop breeding. Tight association of cell death with defense responses and processes involved in senescence has been observed in some cell death-related mutants of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. A loss-of-function mutant analysis of <italic>ACCELERATED-CELL-DEATH11</italic> (<italic>ACD11</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, for example, implied that both defense- and senescence-related signal pathways may lead to programmed cell death in plant leaves [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A recent study of allelic variation at the <italic>ACD6</italic> locus in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> revealed a negative correlation between the amount of vegetative growth and level of resistance to pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The hyperactive <italic>ACD6</italic> allele, inducing delayed growth and reduced biomass, strongly enhances disease resistance. This result indicates that some lesion-mimic mutant alleles can provide significant advantages for pathogen attack despite their negative effects on biomass. In the case of hybrid chlorosis triggered by the <italic>Hch1</italic>-<italic>Hch2</italic> interaction, a similar trade-off between disease resistance and reduced biomass could be assumed. In particular, it might be expected that the negative effects on biomass of mild chlorosis-showing plants could be minimized and substantial fitness conveyed under pathogen-polluted environments. Activation of SA-related immune responses surely reduces fitness in the absence of pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but increases it in the presence of pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0121583.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Fine-tuning of the trade-offs of the <italic>Hch1</italic>-<italic>Hch2</italic> interaction would be required for substantial use of mild chlorosis in wheat breeding under inferior environments, such as fields with frequent occurrence of disease. Production of near-isogenic lines for <italic>Hch1</italic> and <italic>Hch2</italic> should be effective for precise evaluation of the trade-offs between disease resistance and reduced biomass in further studies.</p>

The inoculated plants were then transferred to the growth chambers, and disease symptoms were observed 8 d after inoculation. The entire experiments for the powdery mildew resistance assay were repeated two times.</p>
