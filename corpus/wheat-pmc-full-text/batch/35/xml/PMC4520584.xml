      <abstract>
        <p>The speciation of pathogens can be driven by divergent host specialization. Specialization to a new host is possible via the acquisition of advantageous mutations fixed by positive selection. Comparative genome analyses of closely related species allows for the identification of such key substitutions via inference of genome-wide signatures of positive selection. We previously used a comparative genomics framework to identify genes that have evolved under positive selection during speciation of the prominent wheat pathogen <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> (synonym <italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic>). In this study, we conducted functional analyses of four genes exhibiting strong signatures of positive selection in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. We deleted the four genes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> and confirm a virulence-related role of three of the four genes <italic>&#x394;Zt80707</italic>, <italic>&#x394;Zt89160</italic> and <italic>&#x394;Zt103264</italic>. The two mutants <italic>&#x394;Zt80707</italic> and <italic>&#x394;Zt103264</italic> show a significant reduction in virulence during infection of wheat; the <italic>&#x394;Zt89160</italic> mutant causes a hypervirulent phenotype in wheat. Mutant phenotypes of <italic>&#x394;Zt80707</italic>, <italic>&#x394;Zt89160</italic> and <italic>&#x394;Zt103264</italic> can be restored by insertion of the wild-type genes. However, the insertion of the <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt89160</italic> orthologs from <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> do not restore wild-type levels of virulence, suggesting that positively selected substitutions in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> may relate to divergent host specialization. Interestingly, the gene <italic>Zt80707</italic> encodes also a secretion signal that targets the protein for cell secretion. This secretion signal is however only transcribed in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, suggesting that <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>-specific substitutions relate to a new function of the protein in the extracellular space of the wheat-<italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> interaction. Together, the results presented here highlight that <italic>Zt80707</italic>, <italic>Zt103264</italic> and <italic>Zt89160</italic> represent key genes involved in virulence and host-specific disease development of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. Our findings illustrate that evolutionary predictions provide a powerful tool for the identification of novel traits crucial for host adaptation and pathogen evolution.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p><italic>Zymoseptoria spp</italic> provides a unique model system to study the underlying genetics of host specialization of plant pathogens. Closely related <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species, including the prominent wheat pathogen <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, have recently specialized to distinct grass hosts. Positively selected substitutions have played a central role in the acquisition of new host specificities. We have identified a small set of genes showing signatures of positive selection. We demonstrate that three of these four candidate genes play an important role during host infection. Two mutants of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> were impaired in virulence; a third mutant showed a hypervirulent phenotype. New protein specificities not only include changes at the amino acid sequence level but also at the level of the protein structure. We conducted a gene replacement experiment to test if mutant phenotypes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> could be complemented by the insertion of orthologous genes from the two closely related species <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>. For two genes, we confirm that the species-specific protein changes are essential for proper protein functioning in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>; key traits involved in the evolution of virulence and host specificity of this prominent pathogen can be characterized via a combination of evolutionary predictions and functional analyses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Host specialization of pathogens can be a strong driver of diversification and speciation [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Host-driven speciation implies the specialization of traits involved in host interactions from the initial infection and the defeat of host defenses to within-host nutrient uptake, multiplication and reproduction. Even closely related host species may differ in their repertoire of defense-related genes, as well as their biochemical and physical properties. As a result, distinct selection pressures are imposed on infecting pathogens. Genes affected by divergent selection during host specialization can be recognized in pathogen genomes as outlier loci with an excess of genetic divergence [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Positive selection and adaptive changes at the amino acid level are in particular reflected by an accumulation of non-synonymous divergence at the nucleotide level.</p>
      <p>In plant pathogens, divergent selection has been documented in several studies showing specialization of genes related to different functions, e.g., genes encoding effector proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], secondary metabolites [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], toxins [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and genes encoding cell wall-degrading enzymes [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The functional implications of divergent selection are, however, poorly understood. Dong and co-workers elegantly demonstrated that one amino acid change in the oomycete effector protein EpiC1 determines target specificity [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EpiC1 encodes a protease inhibitor that has evolved under strong positive selection during the divergence of the two plant pathogenic <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>mirabilis</italic> infecting different <italic>Solanum</italic> plants and <italic>Mirabilis jalapa</italic>, respectively. The adaptive changes in EpiC1 directly reflect differences in the protease targets of EpiC1 of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>mirabilis</italic>, and the study illustrates the direct functional effect of positive selection.</p>
      <p>For the fungal wheat pathogen <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> (<italic>Mycosphaerella graminicola</italic>), the underlying genetics of host-pathogen interaction is poorly understood. Infection of <italic>Zymoseptoria spp</italic>. involves an initial biotrophic phase where infectious hyphae take up readily accessible sugars in the apoplast. Host cell death is induced after approximately two weeks and involves a strong proliferation of hyphae in substomatal cavities and the formation of asexual fruiting bodies, so-called pycnidia [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Specialization to wheat likely has involved the acquisition and fixation of adaptive substitutions in key genes playing a role in the molecular interaction between host and pathogen. Several non-characterized genes, including genes encoding both secreted and non-secreted proteins, were found to exhibit signatures of positive selection during divergence from the closest relatives <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> were isolated from wild grasses in the Middle East and are unable to infect the host of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> (bread wheat). Divergence of these three species occurred very recently and involved only a few adaptive changes at the genome level [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is likely that these few changes have been instrumental during specialization to distinct hosts. We hypothesize that genes subjected to positive selection during speciation of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> likely have played a role in the specialization to wheat. Using genome-wide analyses of non-synonymous to synonymous divergence, we previously identified a set of 27 positively selected genes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this study, we aim to elucidate the underlying role of four selected genes showing increased ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions. We adopt a reverse genetic approach and show that three of the genes have a strong impact on virulence and reproduction of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> during infection of wheat. Besides amino acid changes, we describe structural variation in transcript lengths including the addition of a signal peptide in one <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>-encoded protein.</p>

        <title>Selection of candidate genes</title>
        <p>We previously conducted a comparative genome study in which we assessed pairwise <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> ratios for more than 9000 aligned genes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>passerinii</italic> with the aim of identifying positively selected genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the present study, we address the functional relevance of a subset of these positively selected genes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. We selected the four genes <italic>Zt80707</italic>, <italic>Zt89160</italic>, <italic>Zt103264</italic> and <italic>Zt110804</italic> for which we previously identified signatures of positive selection using two different approaches [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt103264</italic> were selected from a list of 27 candidates with <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> (computed according to Nei and Gojobori [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], FDR-adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05; Z-test). Both genes show an increased accumulation of non-synonymous substitutions in pairwise comparisons between <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>-<italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>-<italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>. The two genes <italic>Zt89160</italic> and <italic>Zt110804</italic> were selected from the output of a maximum likelihood analysis of gene-wise branch specific <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios in the three <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species. Both genes show increased <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios exclusively in the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> branch. These four genes are all located on the core chromosomes in regions with a well-conserved synteny among the three <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). None of the genes have previously been characterized functionally in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>; however, the gene <italic>Zt89160</italic> is predicted to encode a Regulator of Chromosome Condensation (RCC1) domain [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and <italic>Zt110804</italic> encodes a hypothetical protein containing a proline-rich region predicted to be involved in binding with other proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

        <p>Gene alignments showed that the structure of the reading frames of <italic>Zt89160</italic> and <italic>Zt110804</italic> are conserved between the three <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species with identical start and stop codon positions. However, we verified the open-reading frames of <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt103264</italic> by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE-PCR) in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> as the orthologous sequences for these two genes had different start and stop codon positions. Based on sequencing of transcripts, we revealed significant differences in transcript lengths for those two genes among the three <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005055.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005055.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). According to these structural differences, we asked whether the genes are located next to transposons or in regions with frequent re-arrangements. To this end, we analyzed the four loci in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> (isolate IPO323) and compared them with the orthologous loci in the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> isolate STIR04_2.2.1 (here termed Zp13) and the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> isolate STIR04_1.1.1 (here termed Za17) [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We found transposable and repetitive elements in the vicinity of the neighboring genes (&lt;30kbp) but none directly associated (&lt;2kbp) with the candidate genes (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). We next re-analyzed the extent of positive selection in the gene models of <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt103264</italic> corrected by RACE-PCR in <italic>Zymoseptoria spp</italic> using a maximum likelihood approach. We applied a branch model to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of branch-specific &#x3C9; values (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios) [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This approach allowed us to compare the branch-specific accumulation of non-synonymous to synonymous divergence in the individual <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> lineages for each gene. An &#x3C9; value above 1 indicates that a gene has been subjected to positive selection in a particular branch of a phylogenetic tree during the divergence of lineages.

        <p>Remarkably, the gene <italic>Zt80707</italic> showed different transcript lengths among the three species, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>. For the orthologous transcripts <italic>Zp80707</italic> in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Za80707</italic> in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>, the transcription start sites are 69 and 75 nucleotides downstream of the start site in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, respectively. The differing transcripts lengths between <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species were confirmed using RT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, based on our RACE-PCR results, we found that the N-terminal end of the gene <italic>Zt80707</italic> encodes a predicted signal peptide transcribed only in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. We computationally predicted the signal peptide with low probability scores using SignalP v3 [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Only the C score (the raw cleavage site score recognizing signal peptide cleavage sites) supported the presence of a signal peptide at the N-terminal end of the gene <italic>Zt80707</italic> (maximal value of C score = 0.581). This weakly predicted signal peptide corresponds exactly to the upstream sequence that is not transcribed in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> or <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>. To experimentally confirm that this signal peptide is transcribed in <italic>Zt80707</italic> and targets the translated protein for secretion, we designed an <italic>in vitro</italic> secretion assay. We used quantitative PCR to measure the expression of <italic>Zt80707</italic> and its orthologs in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae in vitro</italic>, and found that the gene is only weakly expressed during axenic growth. Therefore, the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpdA) promoter from <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was used to express <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zp80707 in vitro</italic> in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> cells. Furthermore, we fused both genes with a C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag. As a positive control for protein secretion, we used the well-characterized Lysine motif (LysM) effector protein Zt111221 [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and as a negative control, we used the non-secreted protein Zt77228 (a predicted member of the intramitochondrial-sorting protein family). The two genes encoding Zt111221 and Zt77228 were expressed as <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zp80707</italic> with a C-terminal GFP tag under the control of the gpdA promoter. Western blot analyses confirmed that Zt80707 is present in both the pellet and supernatant fraction of axenically grown <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> cells, as also shown for the secreted LysM-positive control (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). On the other hand, the orthologous protein from <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and the non-secreted negative control Zt77228 were only detectable in the pellet fraction, revealing that the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> ortholog is not secreted. Together, these results supported an extracellular function of the protein uniquely in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>.</p>

        <title>Reconstruction of protein structure</title>
        <p>To link signatures of positive selection to protein structure and function, we applied a computational method for protein structure prediction; I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Due to the absence of any homologous entries for Zt80707, Zt103264 and Zt110804 in the relevant databases it was not possible to predict the structures of the proteins encoded by these three genes. However, the structural conservation of Zt89160 allowed us to predict the protein structure (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Homologs of Zt89160 can be found in other Dothideomycete fungi, however a pathogenicity-related function has never been shown. The predicted structure of Zt89160 resembles a ring-like RCC1 &#x3B2;-propeller structure containing multiple lateral loops [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We related the predicted structure of Zt89160 to a well characterized RCC1 protein of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> known to interact with nucleosomes (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The conserved structure of the predicted RCC1 protein in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> supports a similar DNA or protein-binding function as described for other RCC1 proteins. Based on the structure of the protein we could assign each site to either central or surface regions. In general we find an excess of substitutions on the surface of the Zt89160 protein; 15.6% in surface regions vs. 4.8% in central regions (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, p-value = 0.00422). This effect is essentially due to an excess of non-synonymous substitutions; 61.1% of all non-synonymous substitutions are in surface regions vs. 38.9% in central regions (Fisher&#x2019;s exact test, p-value = 0.000405), compared to 20% of all synonymous substitutions in surface regions vs. 80% in central regions (Fishers&#x2019; exact test, p-value = 1) (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). The fact that majorities of amino acid differences between <italic>Zymoseptoria</italic> species locate on the surface of the protein suggests that positive selection was driven by divergent DNA sequences or proteins interacting with the different RCC orthologs in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>.</p>

Next, we performed plant experiments to determine the pathogenicity of the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> deletion mutants on the susceptible wheat variety Obelisk (Wiersum Plantbreeding, Winschoten, Netherlands). Disease development was evaluated 28 dpi by assessing the percentage of the leaf area covered with asexual fruiting bodies (pycnidia) of the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> strains (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005055.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005055.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). The formation of pycnidia was significantly reduced on leaves infected with the IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> mutants. Interestingly, the IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt89160</italic> mutant caused a significantly higher amount of pycnidia, consistent with a hypervirulent phenotype.

Our aim was to assess whether the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> ortholog could complement the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> gene if secreted as the native <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> protein. Replacing the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> genes with orthologs from <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> or <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> showed that wild-type virulence could not be restored in any of the replacement strains (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). However, with the fusion construct of the <italic>Zt80707</italic> signal peptide and the Zp13 ORF, it was possible to partially restore wild-type virulence levels, since the resulting amount of pycnidia produced by the mutant &#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic>::sp+<italic>Zp80707</italic> was higher than pycnidia produced by the deletion strain IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic>. This result suggests that the protein encoded by <italic>Zt80707</italic> plays an essential role in the extracellular space of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> and that the amino acid substitutions in Zp80707, acquired since the divergence of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic>, to some extent allow the protein to fulfill the same function as Zt80707.</p>

        <p>To further investigate the quantitative differences in pycnidiospore production between deletion mutants of <italic>Zt80707</italic>, <italic>Zt89160</italic> and <italic>Zt103264</italic> and wild-type that we observe macroscopically, we assessed the amount of pycnidiospores per pycnidium. To do so, we also induced oozing from pycnidia on harvested leaves. We first counted the number of pycnidia per leaf, and then used a &#x201C;Neubauer-improved&#x201D; counting chamber to count the amount of pycnidiospores isolated from the oozing pycnidia. The number of pycnidiospores in the spore suspensions was divided by the number of pycnidia on each leaf from which the spores were isolated. This process enabled us to calculate the number of pycnidiospores per pycnidium. Our findings showed that the pycnidia of the two deletion strains IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> contained significantly fewer pycnidiospores than the wild-type pycnidia (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). However, for the hypervirulent mutant IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt89160</italic> we observed no quantitative difference of pycnidiospores compared to wild-type. The effect on pycnidiospore production could be restored for both IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> mutants by reintroducing the respective gene into the deletion strain (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next confirmed the developmental defect of the pycnidia formation in IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> in comparison to wild-type and the hypervirulent mutant IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt89160</italic> using confocal microscopy. We stained infected leaf samples at 14 and 28 dpi using a wheat germ agglutinin&#x2014;fluorescein isothiocyanate / propidium iodide double staining to visualize both the fungus and plant cells. We measured the width of the pycnidia (n = 50 for each strain and time point) on wheat leaves infected by the wild-type strain and mutants. We find that the size of the pycnidia generated by wild-type <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> and the mutant IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt89160</italic> is almost unchanged from 14 dpi to 28 dpi at 50&#x2013;60 &#x3BC;m (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the mean pycnidia size of IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> is significantly smaller than the wild-type pycnidia at both time points of infection, 14 and 28 dpi (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Pycnidia produced by the hypervirulent mutant IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt89160</italic> on the other hand did not deviate from wild-type pycnidia. We confirmed that the effect found in the IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> mutants is due to the deletion of the two genes, since reintroduction of the respective genes could restore wild-type pycnidia development.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Recent speciation of the wheat pathogen <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> entailed adaptation to a new host and involved a strong effect of natural selection during divergence from a common ancestor of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We hypothesize that signatures of positive selection in the genomes of these pathogens reflect those traits that have been important for divergent host specialization. The functional analyses of four positively selected genes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> allowed us to identify three genes with significant impact on disease development in wheat. For two of these three genes, <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt103264</italic>, we could furthermore show that <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>-specific amino acid changes are crucial for virulence in wheat. Rapid evolution and positive selection of pathogenicity related genes have been documented in other filamentous plant pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Aguileta and colleagues used genome data and EST libraries from different species of <italic>Botrytis</italic> and <italic>Sclerotinia</italic> to search for genes with signatures of positive selection in a dataset of 642 orthologs [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of 21 positively selected genes, four genes were further tested for virulence related functions, but proved non-essential for disease development of <italic>Botrytis</italic> at least as tested under laboratory conditions. The four genes studied by Aguileta and colleagues and the gene Zt110804 included in our functional analyses demonstrate that the relevance of positively selected amino acid changes cannot always be detected with standard experimental assays. Other functional assays could include a variety of host genotypes or different environmental conditions to determine eventual fitness effects in mutant strains.</p>
      <p>For two of the genes studied here, <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt10324</italic>, we not only find variation at the level of nucleotide substitutions, but also at the level of reading frame structure. To our knowledge this is the first report of large variation of reading frame structure variation in virulence related genes of a fungal plant pathogen. A dramatic consequence of the different transcript start of <italic>Zt80707</italic> in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> is a signal peptide that is only transcribed and translated in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. Thus, in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, the protein encoded by <italic>Zt80707</italic> acts in the extracellular space and may interact with host-produced proteins while orthologous proteins in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> act intracellularly. In <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>, but not in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic>, there is a methionine at the corresponding site of the transcription start in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. However, our 5&#x2019; RACE-PCR experiment clearly shows that the transcription start of <italic>Za80707</italic> is initiated 25 amino acids downstream (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Either, transcription of the signal peptide in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> was lost after divergence of the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> lineage, or, more plausible, the earlier transcription start originated more recently in the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> lineage. We speculate that non-synonymous substitutions in the <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> gene relate to a novel function of the protein in the extra-cellular space. Indeed the function of Zt80707 could not be fully restored by integration of the orthologs from <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> with or without the secretion signal (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Further characterization of protein function in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic> and the more distantly related sister species <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>passerinii</italic>, will be necessary to clarify the ancestral structure and function of the protein.</p>
      <p>The deletion mutants of both <italic>Zt80707</italic> and <italic>Zt103264</italic> are still able to infect and reproduce asexually in wheat, however the mutants are significantly impaired in the development of pycnidia. We measured this as a reduced number of pycnidia and as significantly smaller pycnidia in the mutant-infected plants. <italic>Zt103264</italic> is upregulated during early host colonization and may therefore play a role in the early establishment of biotrophic growth and defeat of host defenses. The observed effect on pycnidia production would thereby be a secondary effect following lower biomass and impaired pathogen development. <italic>Zt80707</italic> is expressed during necrotrophic growth and pycnidia formation. In other ascomycete fungi, asexual spore formation has been linked to primary and secondary metabolite production [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consistent with an extracellular function of Zt80707 in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>, we did not detect any difference in pigment production during an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell wall and temperature stress assay. Nor did we observe differences in the growth morphology of yeast-like cells or hyphae. We speculate that Zt80707 instead plays a role in host-fungus signaling and interaction and indirectly affects the development of pycnidia in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>.</p>
      <p>The quantitative impact on disease development by the two mutants IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt80707</italic> and IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt103264</italic> suggest that multiple gene products contribute to virulence in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. A single determining virulence factor has also been described in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Deletion of the Mg3LysM effector causes full virulence defect in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. LysM effectors are known to interfere with chitin-triggered immunity in plants and have been described in a number of fungal plant pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is likely that <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> encodes an arsenal of effector proteins during early biotrophic colonization of wheat. These genes may also evolve by positive selection driven by an antagonistic arms-race evolution between effectors and their target proteins. However, the genes picked up by our comparative genome analyses and further investigated here reflect signatures of past positive selection related to speciation and divergent host specialization. Sequencing of more <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> genomes will allow inference of ongoing positive selection in the genome of the wheat pathogen.</p>
      <p>Our third candidate, <italic>Zt89160</italic>, exhibited a hypervirulent phenotype. Mutant hypervirulence has only been described in a few examples of fungal plant pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Zt89160 contains two RCC1-like domains. RCC homologues have been characterized as nuclear proteins in many eukaryotes, including <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Disruption of the gene in different organisms affects RNA processing and transport, mating, initiation of mitosis and chromatin condensation. So far RCC1 proteins have never been studied in a fungal plant pathogen or connected to fungal pathogenicity. We speculate that Zt89160 could play a central role in the regulation of virulence-related genes in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> consistent with the increased pycnidia formation in the deletion mutant. The hemibiotrophic nature of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic> requires a fine-tuned regulation of transcription during host infection and the switch from biotrophic feeding to necrotrophic feeding, and this regulation may be affected in the IPO323&#x394;<italic>Zt89160</italic> mutant. Positive selection acting on the gene could reflect changes in the binding sites of Zt89160 relative to the orthologs in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic> and <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>ardabiliae</italic>. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that most amino acid substitutions locate on the outer surface of the protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
      <p>In summary, we here show a strong correlation between evolutionary predictions and virulence function in a plant-pathogenic fungus. Previous studies of prokaryote and eukaryote pathogenic species have likewise demonstrated accelerated evolution of virulence-related genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The focus of these studies has been the evolution of effector-encoding genes, typically small, secreted proteins. Our selection of candidate genes has however been determined only on the basis of evolutionary predictions and no <italic>a priori</italic> information about gene function or structure. We demonstrate that adaptive evolution during host specialization also strongly affects non-secreted proteins without a putative effector function (Zt89160, Zt103264 and Zt110804). Even so, several of these genes may play a central role in virulence through the regulation of other genes or impact on <italic>in planta</italic> development of hyphae and spore production. The findings presented here suggest that the integration of evolutionary predictions and functional analyses provide a strong framework for the identification of new pathogenicity-related traits and host species determinants of pathogens.</p>

We used the 5&#x2019; RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends Kit (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and designed three gene-specific primers (GSPs) for each gene for the first strand cDNA synthesis, for a first PCR GSP2 and a nested GSP3 for a nested PCR (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).

A spore solution of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was brushed onto an 8&#x2013;10 cm marked area of the second leaf of each plant.

        <title>Phenotypic assays</title>
        <p>We performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of wild-type and deletion mutants to test whether any observed phenotype relates to the host-pathogen interaction or to basic growth performance of the mutants. First, we investigated single cells of the wild-type and the deletion mutants microscopically using a light microscope (Leica DM750, Wetzlar, Germany). Next, we conducted a stress assay to investigate whether deletion mutants were affected in their response to cell stress reagents. Four &#x3BC;l of a spore suspension containing 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>7</sup> spores/ml and 6 1:10 dilutions of a dilution series were pipetted on stress plates and incubated for six days at 18&#xB0;C. We grew fungal cells on plates containing NaCl (1.5 M), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (2 mM), Congored (500 &#x3BC;g/ml) and Calcofluor (200 &#x3BC;g/ml) to compare the sensitivity of strains to osmotic and oxidative cell wall stresses. We also incubated fungal colonies at 28&#xB0;C to assess temperature sensitivity. Wild-type, mutant and complementation strains were all assayed for their <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes. To investigate the effect of gene deletion <italic>in planta</italic>, we compared disease development of wild-type and mutant-infected plant leaves 28 dpi. Symptoms recognized as pycnidia were evaluated. To quantify disease levels, we used a scoring scheme of six categories (0%, 1&#x2013;20%, 21&#x2013;40%, 41&#x2013;60%, 61&#x2013;80% and 81&#x2013;100%) representing the percentage of the leaf area covered with pycnidia. 48 wheat leaves infected with wild-type were compared to 59&#x2013;96 leaves infected with deletion mutants, complementation or replacement strains (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005055.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005055.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Disease scoring was done by eye always by the same person. A Mann-Whitney-U-test was applied to test the statistical significance of the observed differences between wild-type all and mutant strains.</p>
        <p>We evaluated and compared pycnidia spore viability from wild-type and the <italic>Zt80707</italic>- and <italic>Zt103264</italic>-deletion mutant-infected leaves. The infected leaves were harvested four weeks after infection and surface sterilized using 5% sodium hypochlorite and 70% ethanol. The infected leaves were incubated under high-humidity conditions for seven days on a metal grid in a sealed Petri dish in the phytochamber with the same light settings as the infection experiment (see above). The high-humidity conditions in the Petri dish induce the oozing of pycnidia and the release of spores. The whole-leaf samples were vortexed gently in 500 &#x3BC;l sterile H<sub>2</sub>O and 1:10 dilution series were made with three steps. Three &#x3BC;l of every dilution was pipetted on YMS and YMS-hygromycin plates. The proportions of germinating spores were compared between the wild-type and the deletion strains (<xref rid="ppat.1005055.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>

Therefore, we also induced oozing from pycnidia on harvested leaves and then used a &#x201C;Neubauer-improved&#x201D; counting chamber to count the amount of pycnidiospores isolated from the oozing pycnidia. The number of pycnidiospores in the spore suspensions was divided by the number of pycnidia on each leaf from which the spores were isolated to estimate the number of pycnidiospores per pycnidium.</p>

        <p>To investigate the presence of a putative signal peptide at the 5&#x2019; end of the gene <italic>Zt80707</italic>, we analyzed the transcribed sequence using SignalP 3.0 [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. SignalP only returned weak evidence for a secretion signal and we therefore aimed to experimentally verify the putative signal peptide. To do this, we designed a construct for stable expression of <italic>Zt80707</italic> in a non-coding region of chromosome 1 (Chr1: 464436&#x2013;466636) in <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>tritici</italic>. <italic>Zt80707</italic> is only weakly expressed in axenic culture and we therefore expressed it under the control of the constitutively induced gpdA promoter from <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To verify secretion in a Western blot-based experiment, we also fused a 3&#x2019; GFP tag to the <italic>Zt80707</italic> sequence. In addition to <italic>Zt80707</italic>, we also generated a construct with the ortholog <italic>Zp80707</italic> of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>pseudotritici</italic>. The ORFs were cloned into the plasmid pES150 by Gibson assembly [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The positive and negative controls, <italic>Zt111221</italic> and <italic>Zt77228</italic>, respectively, were also expressed under control of the gpdA promoter and tagged with a 3&#x2019; GFP. The constructs furthermore included a Geneticin resistance cassette and 1 kb flanking region of the non-coding locus at chromosome 1 in order to allow for correct integration of the constructs at this site via homologous recombination. After transformation of the four constructs in IPO323, positive transformants were grown in 50 ml YMS medium at 200 rpm and 18&#xB0;C for 72 h until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1. For protein extraction, the cultures were centrifuged at 10000&#xD7; g for 15 min. Protein extraction from the cells was conducted using a peqGOLD TriFast kit (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. For precipitation of the proteins in the supernatant, 40 ml of each culture was lyophilized and dissolved again in 1 ml H<sub>2</sub>0. This same methodology was used for a TCA precipitation [<xref rid="ppat.1005055.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and the resulting protein pellet was dissolved in 50 &#x3BC;l 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford reagent in order to load similar amounts on a 15% SDS gel. This was confirmed by a Coomassie staining of the SDS gels to show similar protein amounts for the pellet and supernatant lanes. Hereafter, a Western blot analysis was performed using electrophoretic transfer. Finally, the proteins of interest were detected using an a-GFP primary antibody (Roche), together with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked secondary antibody (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) and the Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany).</p>
